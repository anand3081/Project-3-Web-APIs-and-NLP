327,0,from your first beer to now how do you reflect on your acquired taste for beer when i wa about 12 my family went to a bar for dinner i got a root beer to go in a styrofoam cup when we got home i thought i’d lost the cup but i find the styrofoam cup on my parent dresser i went to drink it and it turned out to be beer why my parent had a beer in a styrofoam cup with a lid and straw at home i’ll never know but it tasted so bad then later in life when i first started drinking at 17 i had to force myself through a beer to fill the effect now i really enjoy a beer after work i enjoy the taste the bitterness and all it’s something carbonated that isn’t sweet or flavorless recently i had covid for a week so of course i didn’t drink when i finally felt normal i cracked my first beer again and suddenly the flavor tasted like the first beer i ever had all those year back i didn’t taste like my usual favorite beer it just tasted like a general beer like the way it smell the taste is back to normal for me but it wa a trip to taste a beer for the “first time” again even though it wa only a week of not drinking one i didn’t even lose my taste or smell during the covid what wa it like for you how wa your first beer

348,0,first all grain brew is in the fermenterdid my first all grain brew today i did a verdant ipa recipe by david heath that i converted into normal measurement substituted a couple of grain that he used that i couldn t get at my lhbs and upped the hop amount minimally i used my new brewzilla 3 1 1 and am favorably impressed with it s operation i set it up last night to come on at 530 this morning to begin heating the strike water to 156 when i got up at 6 it wa already at 120 so i switched it to manual from there on around 630 i began to mash in it really felt weird to me stirring the grain especially the one at the bottom where they were thick but i had never done it before and had no idea what it should feel like after a few minute of stirring chopping motion up and down with the paddle and using the paddle like a shovel to lift grain from the bottom to the top i felt i should be good to go i did stir in three handful of rice hull just in case a there wa 1 5 pound of oat in the grist i wa unable to check the mash ph a my wife s ph meter that she used to use for making cheese decided to not work today brewfather wa pretty much right on with all the rest of it s calculation and it calculated my to be 5 49 so a long a that is close i should be ok i set the temp to maintain the 149 degree temperature and then i put the top plate in place and started the recirculation for the mash at first i tried to keep the water level low on the top plate but after 10 minute or so i thought i should turn the pump up a bit and raise the level because by my logic could be totally wrong idk having a higher wort level on the top plate would exert a little more downward force resulting in the little bit higher flow through the grain bed all went well for the remainder of the mash at the end of the 60 minute i raised the temperature to 170 for mashout i forgot to measure how long the bz took to get there but it wasn t long during the mash i had heated my sparge water in the kitchen using the kettle i had been using for extract brewing i wa concerned about lifting the mash pipe out due to the weight on my extremely f ed up shoulder but not to worry it wa actually easy to lift out it drained quickly and the entire sparge only 2 gallon only took like 5 minute i removed the malt pipe and put it in a clean food grade bucket not expected the roughly one quart of wort that drained into there i thought it wa finished not a problem it wa a clean bucket so into the kettle it went pre boil gravity wa 1 044 when it should have been 1 046 i ll take it raising the temp to a boil took a bit but not overly long there wa a small amount of grain particulate in the wort but really not very much the bz got the wort to a pretty decent boil not violent but pretty good about right where i would try to set my extract batch i put 10 drop of fermcap s in right before the start of the boil and the hot break wa a total non issue the boil and addition were totally textbook no problem 10 minute before the end of the boil i put on the whirlpool arm and put the chiller in to sanitize them i used a inexpensive pond pump off of amazon in a bucket of ice water to chill i wa supposed to be using a cooler instead but the cooler wa leaking it s been year since it ha been used for anything other than to keep smoked pork butt hot while they rest after cooking cooling down to the hop stand temperature took only a couple of minute i turned off the chiller and left the whirlpool running for the hop stand then fired up the chiller again to further cool i forgot to take off the blanket and i m sure that hurt my cooling a bit note to self for next time but i wa only able to cool to about 105 before i wa totally out of ice oh well i just put it into the fermenter and into the mini fridge at 60 degree to further chill to pitch temperature after i wa done chilling a much a i could i carefully removed the chiller then whirlpooled for another 5 minute then let it settle for 10 to try to get the hop sludge to cone up on the false bottom quantity to fermenter wa 5 20 and og wa 1 050 supposed to be 1 052 again i ll take it i used the pump to put the wort into the fermenter and i placed a sanitized 200 micron paint strainer bag in my fermenter bucket because i wanted to see how much crap got past the false bottom and into the fermenter i had intended to take a picture of it but there wa nothing to take a picture of i am totally impressed with the false bottom in the bz lesson learned 1 check be aware of equipment status before brew day ph meter and cooler 2 i need better tubing for my chiller what i have is thin walled silicone and it kink flattens out way to easy obstructing flow 3 i harvest ice from my fridge ice maker and put it in a plastic bag then store it in the porch freezer until needed i need to harvest more and will also be freezing a \ \ \ \ ton of cool freeze pack that i have to add a well will be buying another cooler which will give more volume for ice water a well don t know if i ll be able to reach pitch temp or not of course by the time i wa chilling it wa close to 100 ambient temperature so there is that

475,0,is it possible to buy the actual european version of european beer in the u read more for detail for context when i say european and american version i don t necessarily mean there are two different formulation specifically i mean the true original form of the beer you d find in europe e g 330ml v the same beer you d find in america e g 11 2 fl oz so a few month ago i traveled to brussels and while i wa there i fell in love with a little lady named delirium tremens png in my opinion it s got the perfect balance of sweet bitter and carbonation that make it ideal for any occasion i bought two 4 pack and brought them home to the u with me and since those ran out i ve been able to find them at various liquor store here in the state the problem is like with many imported european beer i ve tried i ve found that the american version is much more carbonated than the true european version my thought is either this ha to do with needing to preserve the beer s original taste over the longer distance and time necessary for importing or it s a result of the beer being stored for longer over that duration regardless i much prefer the original carbonation factor of the true european version if i had to describe the difference in layman s term the carbonation in the european version feel much more foamy a in the bubble physically feel smaller and more dispersed across the tongue whereas the carbonation in the american imported version feel much more fizzy i e the carbonation feel more sharp and overpowering nbsp so i actually have two question one general and one specific 1 general question is there an actual difference in the carbonation between european beer and those same beer that are imported to america if so what is the reason for this 2 specific question is there a way american consumer can purchase the true original european version of imported european beer i e volume denoted by ml instead of fl oz and i don t mean in term of specific store but more so doe the ability exist i know of several place like world market that specialize in imported good and imported beer sold at those place may or may not be denoted in ml instead of fl oz but i am not sure if the difference in carbonation in the european v american version is due to difference in the way the beer are actually produced or if it ha to do with the fact that the beer is imported and inherently sits in storage transportation for longer causing the carbonation to change in other word if the difference is due to the latter then maybe there would be no difference in taste between the 330ml and 11 2 fl oz version simply due to the fact that both had to spend additional time in transit to the u thank you

a he poured and gave me a lot of very interesting information and anecdote we had a great time chatting about our life and i got to try a broad range of ferraton s offering 2021 ferraton saint peray le mialan 100 marsanne grown on limestone and granite citrusy and peach note hit you right out of the gate with a minerality after that quickly fade a bit of effervescence detectable which surprised me very refreshing and not at all what i have had before with a marsanne 2020 ferraton saint joseph blanc la source 100 marsanne grown on granite soil round mouthfeel with defined minerality and then the floral and lightly honeyed note you expect in marsanne more rounded due to more oak than saint peray but lacked the freshness i loved in the saint peray 2020 ferraton crozes hermitage blanc la matiniere 100 marsanne grown on limestone i found it a bit bland it lacked the freshness and acidity i liked about the saint peray and didn t have even the limited depth of the saint joseph 2019 ferraton hermitage blanc le miaux 100 marsanne grown on plot on hermitage hill with clay and limestone soil with round pebble at surface and some granite soil the polar opposite of the saint peray but it tied a my favorite ferraton blanc with the s peray very complex on the palate with note of pear peach and other stonefruit a well a honey and light touch of oak noticeable will likely deepen and round out nicely in a few year 2019 ferraton hermitage blanc la reverdy 50 marsanne and 50 roussane from le meal limestone and alluvial and le beaumes round pebble plot it wa bigger and had a more rounded mouthfeel with more evident oak than the le miaux blanc i prefer lighter oak in white and liked the subtleness of the miaux blanc more 2020 ferraton crozes hermitage rouge le picheres 100 syrah on limestone with pebble on surface bit of light cherry and black fruit note and not much else i found this bland and lacking 2019 ferraton cornas lieu det patou 100 syrah on granite slope very grippy tannin at this young age that will likely subside very good black fruit note with a good light barnyard funk very elegant structure that also had power it wa my favorite of the ferraton rouge 2017 ferraton saint joseph rouge 100 syrah on steep granite slope bright cherry note most evident and strong tannin not bad but le elegant and structured than the cornas and lacked the funk i like 2016 ferraton hermitage rouge le miaux 100 syrah from le dionieres alluvial with pebble at surface and le meal round pebble plot black fruit note most evident without much else to speak of and only faintest hint of the leather funk or smoked meat i wa looking for this wa the first actual hermitage i ve ever tasted and i wa disappointed it wa a big wine but lacked the powerful but complex structure i expected 2018 ferraton cote rotie lieu dit montmain 100 syrah on micashistes and granite soil very elegant with restrained yet grippy tannin good mix of red and black fruit note with

cave de tain wine 2020 cave de tain saint peray marsanne and roussane couldn t find percentage on limestone soil bright and refreshing with citrusy and peach note but not complex or crisp a the ferraton hermitage blanc 2020 cave de tain crozes hermitage blanc 100 marsanne on varied pebbly alluvial and granite soil good mix of stone fruit and floral note with a very slight effervescence it wa fine but did not stand out among blanc tasted during my trip 2019 cave de tain crozes hermitage rouge 100 syrah on varied pebbly alluvial and granite soil red fruit wa prevalent but tannin and acidity

715,1,dom perignon rosé 2005 a treat i had a few week ago here’s my review and comparison to other domsa few day ago i gave a review of the regular dp 08 my fave ever since i had that one i wa sold on dp and wa so excited to try a rosé this 05 wa the one i could get my hand on recently it’s not one of the “known” vintage but i wa happy with it nonetheless at the nose there’s a toasty brioche and somewhat fruity zest tropical note along with some sweet hint of cocoa the taste is what i wa expecting like the 08 i had the brioche burnt smokey wood taste wa there but it being a rose it ha an elegant way of combining that with a nice fruit peach strawberry note i wa overall very happy with this but honestly the regular dom vintage are amazing it’s almost hard to really upgrade to one of their rosés in term of the price i’d say i wouldn’t spend a much on this exact bottle again it’s rather spend le on a know vintage that’s not rose however now that the rosé 08 ha been released i’m really looking forward to trying it

719,1,last night in st emilionthe four bottle we tasted on our final night in st emilion it’s been a lovely week here clos saint martin 2015 st emilion grand cru classé porte chic 2016 pomerol troplong mondot 2011 st emilion 1er cru b gcc troplong mondot 2019 “ “ winner were the tm 2019 and csm 2015 they are very different style troplong mondot especially since it new ownership in 2017 is powerful concentrated dark fruit delicious modern pretty straightforward of course the 2019 is very young clos saint martin on the other hand which we only discovered on this trip is exceedingly elegant on the mouth with great finesse and refinement with note of sweet black fruit toffee clove on the nose they’re both fantastic and in our opinion very good value for what you get they can both be had for about 105 or thereabouts you may be able to find the csm for quite a bit le but then you may not be able to find it at all porte chic is a strange one all the shop in st emilion want to recommend it a a “starter” pomerol it €45 which is cheaper than many pomerol but it didn’t impress u nose ha plum and opulent fruit of black cherry but it ha drying tannin that aren’t well integrated and a green note and it wa a bit hard for u to appreciate seemed like it needed food and a lot of air maybe too young the troplong mondot 2011 is also fascinating this is from the old ownership of christine valette who really built up tm but pursued a very different style to the current management this wine ha very drying tannin and seems hard to appreciate but if you can get past that there’s quite a lot of elegance and interest here in addition to the typical dark fruit berry note for st emilion there are fig and christmas mulled wine note that are quite alluring absolutely need food pairing because of the tannin this wine changed our opinion a bit on 2011 a a vintage lot of thing to say about st emilion a a place to visit but i’ll save it for another post when we are back home i don’t see many post on wine from here which is a shame a it’s one of our favorite region complete note are on cellar tracker user name “brendel” for these and some 40 other wine we tried here

813,1,pinot noir getting started on the wrong footi started seriously learning about wine over the past year like many people who start taking a closer interest in wine i wanted to get into pinot noir mainly because of it reputation i haven’t tried much mainly because of the expense but i’ve tried a few domestic bottle and i’m having trouble finding something i really like a well a something that carry a lot of varietal characteristic most of what i know about pn’s character is from what i’ve read or heard about it so i reviewed the pns i’ve tried so far to see if anyone here can help me learn from my experience and come up with some idea for what i should try so i can get a better idea of what pn can be to give you an idea of what my taste are my favorite wine right now are chianti barolo malbec and garnacha grenache i do like white wine but i haven’t tried enough varietal style to fairly pick a favorite i’ve mostly had chardonnay disclaimer i know that taste in wine is subjective and these are just my opinion i don’t judge anyone who like what i don’t like and vice versa i am a strong believer in letting people have nice thing not being a gatekeeper it should be noted that it ha been month since i drank these and i m going off of what i remember also i definitely still consider myself a novice in the world of wine that said here go elouan 2019 i didn’t hate it but but i didn’t love it either it wa a much darker color than i would expect for a typical pn very opaque it wa really smooth and had nice round tannin which i liked easy drinking the fruitiness wa more strawberry than cherry it wasn t very complex but that’s what you get for 20 not a terrible value but what i’ve read about this bottle seemed to indicate that it isn’t a typical representation of pn’s varietal characteristic i liked it just okay but i don’t think i would go back to it anytime soon it did make me want to try higher quality willamette valley pns though martin ray bootlegger’s hill russian river valley 2020 this one wa disappointing it wa kind of pricey 60 i got it at a discount the color looked typical for pn lighter and more transparent than the elouan it fell a bit flat on the palate though it wasn’t particularly complex and it wa a little on the bland side it wasn’t all that memorable so i struggle to remember what it even tasted like i do recall a little bit of cherry and some herbaceous funk but it tasted very watered down i remember having an “eh kind of a letdown” feeling about it while drinking it flower russian river valley 2020 i absolutely hated it very bitter and lot of va i remember it being herbaceous a little grassy on the palate with the faintest hint of cherry mostly the acid the fruit wa basically nonexistent i don’t think it wa corked i’ve had corked wine and it wasn’t the same it wasn’t vinegar but i didn’t enjoy it i would sum it up a sour dirt i can’t think of many wine that i’ve disliked more than this one wa about 37 i know there are great pns from sonoma rrv and willamette but i don’t think i’ve been trying the right thing for my taste i haven’t even tried german pinot nz pinot or red burgundy yet believe me i plan to i don’t think i dislike pn a a varietal i have only tried 3 so it would be totally unfair to make that assumption so if anybody ha any thought or suggestion i would love to hear them tl dr just started seriously learning about wine tried a few pinot noirs and haven’t really liked any of them looking for help in understanding pinot noir a a varietal and some suggestion for what to try since i would like to develop an appreciation for it

816,1,can i store unopened bottle in a regular fridge for a few month my tiny nyc apartment get a ton of light and it’s far too expensive to keep my ac pumping full blast at all time so it’s often in the mid to high 70’s in my apartment i have a few bottle of 1990’s cdp and barbaresco still sitting in storage at winebid’s facility and i’m too scared to ship them because i have nowhere to store them and don’t plan to drink them all in a week can i store them in my fridge for a few month i’ve heard that the cork can dry out but i wa thinking that maybe wrapping the bottle completely and tightly in plastic wrap would mitigate this issue is there a danger of storing wine too cold 
817,1,caymus cabernet is not a bad wine but it is overpricedwith much anticipation i finally splurged on a bottle of caymus today vintage 2020 70 from total wine in nc i found it slightly sweet jammy bright and smooth i got note of oak spice and and excellent dark fruit flavor it had a nice finish and an overall pleasant taste i wa excited to try it but also wary due to so many review calling it a horrible wine i wa half expecting some overly sweet overly altered frankenwine it s definitely not a horrible wine in fact it quite good what it is imo is overpriced i see this bottle can go for 90 in some market that s outrageous i even feel like i overspent at 70 the reason i say this is because i ve had wine just a good likely better at much lower price some example are faust la vielle cure and dame de gaffeliere these can be had for 40 50 i recommend everyone try camus at least once but due to it price i dont see myself being a frequent purchaser of it when i have other option that are a better cost ratio

927,1,help a 24yo get started on his wine collection hi i’m a 24yo guy living in the state thinking to start collecting wine for aging so no investment purpose i’ve never used reddit before but i found this wine community and thought i might get great advice on how to start wine collection i would say i know all the basic about wine so no worry about cellaring condition etc my main question here are 1 where should i start in term of region style etc 2 how to pick specific producer wine vintage on the point 1 i don’t really have strong preference on style of wine so i’m hoping to purchase and collect a diverse style of wine over the coming year the only exception so far is probably californian chardonnay that’s heavily oaked i really drink anything but i’ve never liked them so my strategy right now is start with wine that have a particularly long aging potential like big italian red californian cabernet bordeaux german riesling etc i know these wine with long aging potential tend to be expensive so i’d probably start buying relatively inexpensive one with aging potential at the same time like australian riesling semillon spanish tempranillo etc doe this sound like a good way to start any other advice on deciding where to start on the point 2 i would like to buy 6 to 12 bottle of the same wine and see how they age over the year but i don’t want to buy a case of expensive wine just to find out i don’t like them enough however drinking 10 high end cali cabernet just to figure out which wine i want to buy in a case to age would cost me too much money the best way i can think of is to go to a wine bar and taste a many a possible by glass but by glass selection at a bar restaurant usually doesn’t include high end wine even if it doe that’s only for popular wine producing region such a bordeaux burgundy and californian cabernet and there’s an issue that young wine taste so different from aged wine i generally like wine with some age so even if i get to taste a finest californian cabernet i don’t think i enjoy it that much if it’s very young yet good old wine are either expensive or not available on the market so how can i tell if i would like a specific bottle of wine after 10 year without waiting for 10 year any good idea i’m not experienced enough to predict how a young bottle of wine would age in next 10 and 20 year this is a long post so thanks for reading and any advice is very appreciated

929,1,how to buy winei have recently been getting deeper into the wine world and have some question on how to go about buying wine every time i go into a liquor or grocery store there are so many choice to pick from at every price point i rarely find bottle that are recommended here in the store i frequent even if i know the style of wine i want it can be very daunting to choose i also avoid asking for advice from salesperson because i find they either are not very knowledgeable or they push specific product that they make more on sprit winery direct at total wine how do you choose a bottle of the shelf when you don t know much about the specific winemaker do you just pick one and hope for the best aside from pulling up vivino and checking every bottle for review how can i pick out better wine thank you

935,1,tuscany or sicily i’m planning my first trip to italy in early october unfortunately i am the only wine nerd in the group so it won’t be all about wine we are first timer so we are going to do the obligatory 3 day in rome then we are going south to naples and doing capri and pompeii after that i wa planning on shooting north to florence for a day and then a day and a half in the tuscan wine country the more i am looking at it the more i’m thinking that it’s a long haul for such a short time to spend there a whole week in tuscany would probably be barely enough logistically it would probably make more sense to go down to sicily the only sicilian i have had is nero d’avola and that is right in my wheelhouse i have been meaning to explore other sicilian wine so why not go to the source if anyone want to share any information or tip on touring and tasting down there it would appreciated i wa an avid and successful home winemaker for 20 year and i prefer smaller winery where i might actually talk with someone closer to the winemaking a opposed to a large fancy operation any recommendation on wining and dining in rome and naples would also be welcomed cheer

942,1,classic rioja hello i wa having a discussion with a distributor a few day ago about what classic rioja is when speaking about tempranillo i think we all can understand that when we think of classic rioja we often think of overtly oaky american oak and long barrel time a compared to say a more nuanced bordeaux french oak he wa discussing with me that at it true essence classic rioja is really a lot closer to bordeaux with the influx of bordeaux producer during the 1850 s due to phylloxera we then tasted a great wine conde de hervias torre del hervias rioja 2012 and next to it poured a remelluri reserva rioja 2006 both wine were outstanding but it wa obvious that the remelluri wa wayyy more like a bordeaux than the conde de hervias could it be that it ha 6 more year on it possibly but i really really enjoyed that remelluri all this to say i am visiting spain soon and really want to dig into any producer that you might find produce a tempranillo that range closer to bordeaux in style i ve got ostatu and tritium on my list so far in addition to all the usuals but wa hoping for any further professional insight thanks a ton

996,1,mid upper tier recs based on flavor profile smoky spicy vegetal oaky after sporadically drinking wine over the last several year i recently started paying more attention to what i’m drinking and am finding wine to be hit or miss i would like to take my wine consumption to the next level but think i need some direction the flavor profile that i seem to be drawn to is smoky spicy or oak heavy i had a 2016 barolo recently that i found to be smoky and honestly the best wine i have ever had i also recently had a carmenere that wa spicy and tasted to me like green bell pepper which i loved would like to find more along these line the best wine that i have had thus far barolo – 2016 mauro molino carmenere – 2018 miguel torres gruner vetliner – tegernseerhof oak and earthiness sparkling – cruse wine co tradition this wa phenomenal it tasted like fresh fruit a little different from what i m describing but still amazing pinot noir from willamette valley is hit or miss i really liked the spicy cola flavor of king’s ridge but didn’t care for chehalem or annie amie and thought argyle wa so so the pinot noir from california ha all been average i recognize that a lot of the wine i’ve had is probably budget or value wine and would much prefer to spend more to have a better experience i eat out semi frequently and usually order whatever the most expensive glass is but that doesn’t usually yield very good result recently glass of chianti rhone beaujolais bordeaux gamay malbec and cabernet sauvignon were all disappointing i thought spending more would ensure a better wine so i recently bought bottle of caymus 2016 and silver oak 2016 and honestly didn’t even care to finish the bottle i’m not joking when i say that caymus is probably the worst wine i have ever bought cabernet sauvignon malbec beaujolais all seem to have a distinct cheese flavor that i really don’t care for i don’t want to count any varietal out because it’s possible i just haven’t had a good version yet i know the first recommendation is to develop a relationship with a local wine shop i’m in washington dc and i like macarthur beverage which is where i got the mauro molino recommendation however a wine shop is limited to what they have in stock and i want to go straight to the best that the world ha to offer i will continue to go to macarthur but would also like to order some bottle online that are not available locally based on what i’ve described are there any wine that would be definite home run so to speak i don’t drink frequently enough to need budget friendly option but don’t want to spend 1000 bottle either there are so many option out there that it’s daunting do i just drink 2016 barolo forever should i try robert voerzia or something cheaper like vietti if i try a new varietal should i try the very best i can read review and conclude that i need to try d’yquem and mouton rothschild but what if these don’t fit my taste preference and end up being more expensive version of caymus and silver oak i e overspending on a flavor that i don’t even like i’m dying to know if there is anyone that like and dislike the same type of wine that i do and if so what are the very best wine that you like

1043,1,somm brought wrong wine but i didn’t notice and paid more feelsbadmanwent to a nice restaurant and ended up buying a much more expensive wine than i intended and tbh i’m pretty sure i’m partly to blame i pointed to a €40 alsatian wine from 2019 and that had next to it winery “ riesling pinot blanc pinor gris ” and said “pinot gris” because i thought it meant that winery offered different single varietal turn out that right above that wine there wa a €190 alsace pinot gris from 2012 which is what the somm brought my mistake wa that when he presented it i should’ve recognize that the year wa wrong but he definitely didn’t announce the name of the wine and the year he just showed the bottle poured some i tasted it and said it wa good and that wa that when the bill came i talked to the somm and he said that when i said “pinot gris” then i meant the more expensive one i definitely should’ve caught it when he presented the bottle and i should’ve questioned the year… but man i wish he double checked when i ordered because i definitely and clearly pointed to the €40 wine either way i paid for it because my party drank it but didn’t feel great for the expensive lesson at least it wa a damn good wine tldr a cautionary tale to others make sure you scrutinize the bottle

1100,1,contrary to a popular opinion cabernet sauvignon and aged cheddar is overrated let me preface by saying i have been getting more into wine these past few month so i am bit new to wine tasting anyways this last week i did a bit of research on what wine pair well with and everything i read suggested that cabernet sauvignon and aged cheddar go hand in hand i thought that would be perfect because i really enjoy red wine and cheddar cheese so i figured i would try it out i picked up a bottle of daou 2020 cab and some 6 year aged cheddar from a local grocery mart doms for anyone in the chicagoland area reaction the pairing didn’t seem to play off each other like a malbec and ny strip steak i apologize if that is not a great comparison however the cheddar and wine both had a level tannin that didn’t seem connect one another which made it unpleasant the cheese didn’t seem to have much fattiness or even creaminess to balance the wine tannin i found the wine and cheese to both be pleasant but my argument is that it shouldn’t be paired anyways i am mainly writing this because i am wondering if i somehow did this wrong or if any of you have a better suggestion cheer

1122,1,my first wine experience wayne gretzky vqa cabernet merlot red 13 15didn t plan on having wine today but stumbled on it in a food delivery app and couldn t resist note over a decade ago i actually had wine a couple time but only to get drunk i had no idea of how to taste wine that said i bought gretzky s wine because i figure there s no way he d release wine that taste below it s pricepoint given him being the 1 athlete ever i have seen 20 expert wine tasting video especially the youtube channel wineking i read a blog post linked here which state wine tasting is bull well i m sure it isn t even without any experience because of those vids they accurately identify high quality wine and point out cheap one so i know it s legit not to mention i would say i am and expert master even in ketchup tomato grape share many similarity there are many variety each with their own quality most ketchup a wine from store is trash it s artificially sweetened way sweeter than ketchup is supposed to be therefore while i m a beginner with wine i know this hobby is legitimate when opening the bottle i noticed mostly alcohol grape on the nose in fact the entire tasting the alcohol grape are the only flavor i did not detect anything else likely due to my inexperience but i really took my time and didn t notice anything here are my exact note of the tasting over the course of 20min sip 1 mostly alcohol basically my throat got warm and alcohol went in my nose i must add i have never liked alcohol i grew up never drinking carbonated beverage beer wa not something i enjoyed at least not something i buy to drink for enjoyment same go for all other alcohol i ve had most spirit etc so keep this in mind a i really do not like alcohol sip 2 light mild clear grape not overpowering barely any alcohol flavor pleasant sip 3 big gulp alcoholy sip 4 still nothing on nose big gulp alcoholy sip 5 gulp fruity cinnamon spicy 6 bland 7 nothing to note 8 pleasant 9 fruit still alcoholy overall i would say based on my experience watching many tasting video that this wine is a fair quality for it s pricepoint it definitely isn t bad a few sip were actually enjoyable while the others were mostly overpowering with the alcohol flavor which isn t my thing but i presume every wine ha i don t even know if i have to refridgerate it now so i m gonna google that

1130,1,fruitiness v complexityi wa fortunate enough to try some wine that would typically be out of my price range recently austin hope and artemis the austin hope seemed to be super jammy to me i enjoyed my first glass but after a couple it wa just too sweet for me the artemis seemed to have a bit more tannic or oak structure not sure which than the ah but still ended up just tasting overly sweet toward the end of the bottle i also tried a right bank bordeaux recently i enjoyed it with steak and this wine also seemed quite fruity to me but did have more oak to it than i remembered from the cali cab it wa roughly 80 merlot i keep coming back to spanish rioja though i had a gran reserva recently and much like i ve noticed with other rioja the flavor seemed to evolve a i enjoyed the bottle and each sip ha layer to it with oakyness giving way to fruit and lingering with lovely earthiness are the first three wine i mentioned really fruit bomb or is my palate just not attuned to a more subtle complexity in those wine can i find cab with more complexity like the rioja or is that really just a difference between cali cab and rioja i wa expecting more complexity from the bordeaux but when i considered that it s predominately merlot the fruitiness with light oak made sense would a left bank more cab heavy bordeaux be more complex than the cali cab i tried or should i not expect much different since they re the same grape what style should i seek out going forward that offer more complexity like the rioja i ve been enjoying

1144,1,feeling a bit lost and frustrated trying to find red i like at a reasonable budget detail inside preface this will probably be a bit of a lengthy post so bear with me… i’ve been what i would describe a a “hobbyist” wine drinker on and off for about 6 year what really got me into wine wa getting to try some pretty solid to my palette central ca pinot noirs that showed me that there wa more to red wine than just single note red fruit flavor and i got hooked into finding those wine with multiple level of flavor and complexity fast forward to current day and i feel like i’ve hit a road block when it come to finding wine i enjoy within a reasonable budget in general with red varietal i love wine that have earthy savory non sweet flavor mixed in with the fruit i first loved finding pinot noirs that exhibited that classic earthy mushroom note along with the usual cherry strawberry red raspberry with cabernet i love cab that have that tobacco leather graphite character to them i also love oaky rioja riserva’s and barolo when budget allows recently i wa in leavenworth wa and my wife and i decided to go for a tasting at a local winery there and i tried their 2019 syrah and wa blown away by the gamey savory flavor in it they balanced well with the rest of the wine and i instantly wanted to find more like it so i searched this sub for wa syrah recommendation and went and picked up a handful of bottle in the 25 35 price range sadly none of them had those savory flavor i wa craving and all of them seemed incredibly fruit forward and lacking much depth complexity to them upon reflecting on this i’ve noticed over time that a lot of the wine i purchase just doesn’t give me much complexity or depth of flavor my usual style varietal of choose are pinot noir rhone blend and the occasional rioja but even when i dabble in other varietal like my syrah exploration above everything i buy in that 25 35 price range just seems to be lacking something i ve gotten lucky and found a few budget gem but they seem to be few and far between the only way i ve been able to break this trend is by spending 50 a bottle and that seems to be the sort of breakthrough pricepoint where i find a lot of winner a you might imagine though this isn t financially sustainable for me on a regular basis i m at a loss a to where i m going wrong or why i can t find stuff i like i research not just varietal but region and appellation a well a searching this sub a ton to try to zero in on producer and region that will agree with my taste but i still end up with bottle that i don t end up enjoying any tip guidance you can offer me to answer a few basic question that i m sure will come up i m located in seattle wa i usually shop at my local total wine but have also started shopping at a local wine shop near me that get good review but without much change in my outcome ideally i d like to stay in the 25 35 bottle range but i also realize with some varietal style it can be tough to get quality at this price i m willing to spend more for the right bottle but am trigger shy for the reason laid out above no i don t have covid taste bud and smell receptor are still in great shape thanks in advance

1168,1,wine fridge cooler recommendation i purchased a 32 bottle cooler from wine enthusiast but it arrived damaged so i ll be returning it i had a ge one i picked up out the trash that worked for a little bit it wa able to handle larger bottle not just the bordeaux sized bottle i’m tired of either label being scraped off or removing shelf to stack bottle doe anyone have a recommendation for one stand alone not built in with plenty of room inside that i could pack with larger bottle if i wanted to i d love it if it could turn off or dim the temperature light on the front a well those thing are bright it would also be great to have one that kept appropriate humidity so i can keep some bottle longer term my budget probably cap out at 1 000 capacity between 32 50 bottle 
1169,1,sensitivity to french wineshello all my wife and i are two wine enthusiast however she ha had some strange reaction twice after drinking french wine and i wonder if anyone else ha experienced something similar the first time wa a couple year ago i dont recall the specific wine but it wa a margaux yesterday we had a 2015 cab franc from the chinon region called le pica from the olga raffault winery and she had the same reation basically she felt very sick after we finished the bottle everything wa spinning and she had to sleep on the floor to feel better today she ha a massive hangover and i feel fine i know it sound like she just overdrank but it is not the case since splitting one bottle of wine is not abnormal in our household and she ha only had reaction like these twice in over 4 year always after drinking french wine what we feel like is that she may have some sensitivity to them somehow anyway if anyone know what may have caused this please let u know we would hate to have to stop drinking french wine altogether but we dont want to risk for her to go through that again thank you all in advance
