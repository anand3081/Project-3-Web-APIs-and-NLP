No doubt you‚Äôre here because you‚Äôd like to ask r/beer to help you find a delicious beverage. You‚Äôre in luck, because there are over 400,000 people subscribed here! On the other hand...there are over 400,000 people subscribed here. Some of them probably live near you or have similar access to all of the beers available to you. Most of them don‚Äôt. What does this mean for you? Well my friend, it means you have to help us help you!

All too often, a well-meaning drinker or curious party who would like to start drinking (2020, am I right folks?) will show up on r/beer and post something like ‚ÄúHi what beer should I drink kthanksbye‚Äù. This is no good. First, it doesn‚Äôt give us any information about you. In order to suggest a beer that you should buy, we have to know what beers are available for you to buy. You should start by first telling us where you are. This is absolutely the most important part.

There are a lot of national companies and behemoth corporations that can supply you with large craft beers, very large non-craft beers, and imports. Even still, not everything is everywhere. Hell, assuming all these same beers are available assumes you‚Äôre American, which you might not be. Beyond that, the people of r/beer tend to lean towards smaller craft beer producers that may not distribute their products near you. The first and most important thing you need to do is tell us where to look. For best results, put your general location (state, region, maybe even city) in the title of your post.

Next, tell us what you already drink and like. If you drink beer already, what beers do you like? Wine, liquor, coffee, tea? What kinds of flavors make the pleasure and reward centers in your brain go ‚Äúhell yeah‚Äù? Give us something to go off, and we can find a beer that can do just that. What flavors don‚Äôt you like? We wouldn‚Äôt want to recommend something that you thought was gross, you‚Äôd never trust us again. How can you avoid that? Give us some good information! 

How much money are you looking to spend? Are you on a budget? Do you want to ball out with something priced like a fine wine? Let us know. How much alcohol are you trying to put in you? Beer can range from almost alcohol-free to something resembling wine or hard alcohol, it‚Äôs an incredibly versatile art form. Tell us if you want something crispy to drink while you mow the lawn or if you‚Äôre trying to go a little heavier.

Maybe you‚Äôre looking for something similar to a foreign or narrowly-distributed beer. That‚Äôs fantastic. Beer brings us together and can play a key role in creating memories to last a lifetime. That beer you had on vacation or study-abroad is special, we know. You can help us help you by describing that beer, instead of just leaving it at ‚ÄúI had this beer overseas, find me something like it please‚Äù. Tell us what it looks, feels, and tastes like, and we‚Äôre in a much better position to find an analogue.

Now you know what to do, so now I do have to tell you about one thing you really shouldn‚Äôt do here. Don‚Äôt seek out medical advice disguised as a beer recommendation. Not that often, but still too often, I‚Äôll see something like ‚Äúevery beer I‚Äôve ever had makes my throat close up and my ears sprout horns, what should I drink that won‚Äôt do that?‚Äù That‚Äôs not the question you should be asking. You should be asking a doctor ‚Äúwhy does every beer i‚Äôve ever tried make my throat close up and my ears sprout horns?‚Äù You shouldn‚Äôt be asking beer fans to find you a way around a medical problem. That‚Äôs ill-advised and dangerous. Don‚Äôt do it. We don‚Äôt know you and most of us don‚Äôt have the proper education to help you with that. Don‚Äôt do it.

There. With this information in hand, you‚Äôre now ready to ask for a beer recommendation. Just be sure to take all of this into account and you‚Äôll be fine. You‚Äôll inspire some good discussions and avoid getting downvoted into oblivion and trolled with recommendations of beers you can only buy in person at Belgian monasteries. 

I can‚Äôt prevent other posters from being rude in the comments, but I can arm you with the know-how to prevent them from feeling the need.If someone was unfriendly, it wasn‚Äôt your fault, you just didn‚Äôt know how to ask the right questions. Now you do!

Go in peace, be well, and drink well.

2,t3_wmrj0l,DocGerbil256,What is the best thematic brewery/taproom?,"I'm talking about a brewery or taproom that has an overall theme that is consistent in not only the beer names but the can art and decorum of the taproom. The 3 that I can think of that I've been to are [TRVE in Denver, CO](https://www.trvebrewing.com/) which has a metal theme with black walls, candles on the benches, and metal music playing. Then there's [Dragonsmead in Warren, MI](https://www.dragonmead.com/) which has a Medieval theme with swords, stained glass, and cheesy fantasy art on the walls. The last one I've been to is [Supernatural in Livonia, Mi]( https://www.supernaturalbrewing.com/) which has a Fortune tellers parlor theme with crystal balls, old books and rotary dial phones, and plasma balls.

I'd say of the 3 I listed TRVE probably had the best theming as it was most consistent throughout the whole brewpub, in their beer names and can art, and especially with their awesome merch. Dragonsmead gets a notable mention though as their beer is always at the Renaissance Faire and you can't say no to getting Final Absolution on tap in a wooden tankard while dressed up as a pirate.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just one hit after another - pandemic, aluminum prices, wheat prices, and now CO2 shortages.

With the recent availability issues with CO2 from suppliers across New England, we know that a lot of breweries have moved or are in the process of transitioning as much as possible from CO2 to nitrogen for brewery operations. Since it‚Äôs a new process, there are still a lot of questions on how to effectively make the switch without impacting the quality of the beer - especially with respect to oxygen pick-up and DOs in the final product.

To help small and growing breweries in New England during their possible transition to nitrogen, we would like to support, by using our dedicated QA/QC lab, team, and facilities to test your DOs and can seams for free. Our experienced team will take care of testing DOs, doing seam checks (sample screenshots attached), and sending you a QA report.

Why are we doing this? Because we love great beer, and we believe it‚Äôs important to be a part of the solution for high-quality execution for our friends and community in New England craft beer.

To take us up on this offer or just to learn more, all you have to do is email info@dorchesterbrewing.com or complete the form on our website (https://www.dorchesterbrewing.com/contact-us/) to get the process going. It‚Äôs our way of helping the New England craft community ensure quality, regardless of brewery size.

I live in Northeast Philadelphia and have access to several beer distributors around me that have all the beer I can't stand. Last year, stupid me wait until second week of September to shop for Oktoberfest biers and I missed the boat by a month. I signed up for an alert by phone with my distributor up in Bensalem Bucks County PA, 10 minute drive from my house. I bought Spaten Oktoberfest Ur- Marzen (dark marzen 5.9%, good stuff but Paulaner's Fest Bier takes the cake and I score it 9.6/10 for that official Munich Flavor. 

Since it has a shelf life of about 6 months (it wont last that long) I am going to buy three cases, price be damned! 

Anyone see this at their spot yet? They have Paulaner Fest Bier Half Barrels for 199.99 plus deposit. 15.5 gallons comes out to 165\_1/3 12 oz beers. LMAO I can't drink that much alone but Three cases should last me until about I would say St Patrick's Day.

81,t3_wh3ce0,GrandMasterSeibert,Tired of Hazy IPAs,"I love craft beer and have enjoyed the brewery boom over the last decade. However, the trend over the last few years has ruined my desire to go to any local spots. My favorite style is west coast or imperial IPAs. Anything that has that dry, slightly bitter finish. Barely any places brew anything other than juicy and hazy IPAs now. They are certainly trendy, and more importantly for the brewery, anyone can drink them. My feeling is that juicy and hazy IPAs are great for those who don't actually like IPAs. Am I alone in this take? I did order hazy IPAs back when they weren't as popular if I wanted to mix it up with something easy and refreshing. I did not expect some staple beers to be removed from menus to make room for hazy versions. I understand why they are popular, and I'm sure they generate money because they appeal to all drinkers, but I have no desire to go to a local spot for a drink, something I loved to do. I can sit at home with a perpetual or a two hearted ale and simply enjoy what I'm drinking.

&gt; As a brewery, we brewed the Bitburger Nordic Gold - Premium Lager together with our musical friends from Amon Amarth. The Swedish melodic death metal band was founded in 1992 and draws inspiration for its globally successful songs primarily from Scandinavian history and Viking mythology. To date, the band has released 11 studio albums; the last two albums, ""Jomsviking"" (2016) and ""Berserker"" (2019), each spent 14 weeks at #1 on the German album charts. By the way: The name Amon Amarth goes back to J. R. R. Tolkien's work ""Lord of the Rings"" and can be translated as ""Mount Doom"".

However lately I'm exploring beer/booze again after not drinking for about 30 years (ex-Mormon if you really care, or were worried).

Cost? 
- Budget friendly preferred.

What beers do you like and why?
- So far I have thoroughly enjoyed just about every hefeweizen I have tried. I think I'm just not a big hops fan, and hefes are in my happy place.
- Sch√∂fferhofer Hefeweizen in Pomegranate, Grapefruit, and Passion Fruit have all been delightful (in that order of preference too). They went great with pizza.
- Leinenkugel Summer Peach Shandy was ok, but still too much hops for my preference. I would still drink one if handed to me.
- 3 Sheeps Brewing Bon Bon Chocolate Milk Stout was ok. Bit too strong on hops still, but I did finish it.


What flavors do you like generally?
- Fruit flavors usually always good to me. Especially berries and citrus.
- Coffee/Chocolate notes are appreciated, but they need to be noticable. Faint notes are going to be lost on me I think 
- Found several hard ciders I like so far. Blake's Hard Cider Co Strawberry Lemonade, Down East Blue Slushy Hard Cider was fantastic. I know they're not beers, but it might help.
- Cocktails I like are the cliches, but damn if I don't love em. Margaritas, Daquiris, Jack/Rum &amp; Coke, Bourbon Old Fashions, Long Island Ice Tea (when made well anyway). Bailey's is a delicious liquid dessert.


What flavors don't you like?
- I have basically determined I don't really like IPAs. They're just too hoppy and bitter for my palate. Hops for aroma is great, but hops to pucker my face is not so great.
- Shandy beers have not been good for me so far. I've literally poured out Saugatuck Brewing Company Strawberry Lemonade and Blueberry Lemonade Shandies into the sink rather than finish them.
- Had a Third Space Fruited Sour Lavender Lemonade that was too sour. Happily the lavender wasn't soapy at least. But too sour/bitter/tart I don't think is for me. Mught be good with savory food, but just to sip on wasn't great.

It was sweet too, which i think came from the banana. Went down nicley, also had a nice body to it. Intresting beer i would definitely get again! 

**Wexford irish creme ale**
The most interesting flavored one out of my tryings imo. Very very creamy, but surprisingly really Light. Had a nice body and was thick, but wasnt too thick. Was Very foamy may i add which i really liked. Honestly it was very good, i would definitely get this one again. 

**Sam adams boston lager**
Very creamy/carmely in my opinion. Great body. A thicker beer which i really like. Went down really smooth. I really enjoyed the taste and flavor. Probably the best tasting one for a nightly drinker. Most likely going to be the new go to beer for me.

**Paulaner Munich lager**
This was a great beer. Lots of flavor, with a little sweetness. A nice body to it. ABV wasnt to high but wasnt to low. Went down very smooth. I would definitely get this again. In my opinion it was closer to sam Adam‚Äôs Boston lager than anything else. I really enjoyed both. 

**Carlsberg elephant**
Has a nice sweetness to it. For being a higher ABV, its nowhere near as strong as some of the high abv‚Äôs ive had in the past. Im suprised that the taste is that flavorful being over 7%. It went down nicley without any bitterness. It was a good beer. 

**Michelob ultra**
Super light taste. Not much body or falvor. Went down super easy. For how suprisingly light this was I actually Liked it, but the lack of flavor will not make it my go to.

**Blue moon White Belgian** 
Nice body, went down almost as easy at michelob but with much more of a flavor profile. I really liked this beer. Almost as much if not the same as sam adams and banana. For a wheat beer it was buttery in my opinion, which i really enjoyed.

**Left hand penut butter milk stout nitro**
Upon first sip i didnt think i liked it. But the more i drank it‚Ä¶.the more i liked it but then i drank it some more, and the less i liked it. It was super thick, with a strong peanut flavor. High in calories. Flavor was ehh after awhile. The heavyness of it turned me off. I could drink 4 michelobs and still have room for more. One of these and i was full. I didnt like this beer, really at all. Would not get it again. 

**Miller highlife**
Sweeter than others ive tried but not as thick which i didnt care for. I like a thicker beer for some reason. Like i said, it was sweet which i did like but Not much body, and other than the sweetness the flavor was eh. Not the worst beer ive had but nowhere near the best. I put it in the same ranking as michelob ultra but worse in my opinion. Tasted like budweiser. Wouldnt get it again. 

**Landshark Island style lager** 
Pretty nice sipper. Not bitter and relatively light. Definitely better than miller highlife but nothing special. Just another regular beer to me. Tastes like Budweiser. Probably wouldnt get it again.

Sorry this post is so long, but all in all i think i liked Sam Adams Boston lager the best out of all the ones i tried, with Paulaner Munich and the Wexford irish creme ale both as close seconds. Runner up would definitely be the banana bread beer, i really liked that one too! Thank you all again. You sure didn‚Äôt disappoint! ill make another one of these that includes more of your guys suggestions once ive tried them! Have a nice day everyone!",beer

That's actually really low. Not quite as low as actual light beers which are between 90-110 calories per 12 ounce. 

For comparing, your average macro lager like Coors Banquet and Budweiser are 150 calories per 12 ounce. And craft ales tend to be about 160-180 calories per 12 ounce. 

I was surprised when I found out, I always assumed Guinness was a little ""heartier"" and thus higher calorie.

183,t3_w9tp0y,LongIsland1995,State of the beer industry,"I'm interested in the trends of the beer industry.

Both macro and craft are declining (presumably due to the popularity of hard seltzer and hard tea). From my observations, a lot of zoomers these days aren't even developing a taste for beer and just drink hard seltzers, alcopops, and mixed drinks.

I am not in the industry and don't know anyone in the industry. So my knowledge of this topic is limited to what I see available in real life, what I see on the internet, beer lists found on brewery websites, and beer articles related to trends in the industry.

It seems that:

Domestic non-light macro lagers like Budweiser, Coors Banquet, and PBR will continue to plummet in popularity. Their light counterparts will suffer a smaller decline, except for certain brands like Michelob Ultra which are actually getting more popular. I'm gradually seeing Michelob Ultra replace Bud Light as the dudebro beer of choice when I go to bars.

At least while inflation is a big issue, budget light beers like Busch Light will gain in popularity.

Certain Mexican beers like Modelo and Pacifico will continue to gain populatity. Both the rise in the US Hispanic population, the trendiness of Mexican lager are contributing to this. Furthermore, they appeal to people who want something with more flavor than a Bud Light, but aren't into IPAs. That's what happened to me, I've been drinking a shitton of Modelos these last few years.

Craft beer overall will decline in sales, and breweries will continue to focus more and more on IPAs. Lagunitas and Sierra Nevada (for instance) already seem to be committed to doing this. SN replacing their Oktoberfest with an IPA is a sign of things to come.

Sorry for the rant. As someone who loves beer and has been drinking it on a regular basis for 12 years,  just find this topic interesting and concerning.

I remember 5 to 10 years ago, a lot of beer people thought that craft beer would replace macros, or at least continue to take from their market for the foreseeable future. Clearly this is not happening.

I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. What trends do you think we'll see.",beer

Basically something you buy to get drunk, not to enjoy the taste of beer. Now I know both are pretty shit beers, so I'm not sure if I only disliked them because of the high alcohol, or because of their bad taste. So does all high abv beer taste like alcohol?

Btw my favorite beers are stuff like corona/stella/heineiken, pretty basic stuff. And I never liked any macro north american beer (like bud/coors/miller).

First time posting here. A couple years back, I tasted my first craft beer, and absolutely fell in love with it. Something about them just hit differently than drinking standard beer. Ever since then, I began trying out different styles of craft beers from various breweries, starting with breweries local to Maryland. From there, I decided to take back a little bit from each of those that I visited, and thought the best way to remember them was buying one of their custom growlers.

From that point on, I have been able to collect a total of 132 unique custom growlers, from 19 different states in the US. I have attached photos of the growlers, and have also provided a google docs link that gives a more detailed description of the breweries that I visited. Quick note, this link only includes breweries I visited that also sold growlers, I have been to other breweries, but not all of them had custom growlers to buy.

Just wanted to share with you all something that's been pretty amazing and fun to do. And I am always open to suggestions of breweries to visit.

Thanks!

264,t3_w44er6,HuckleberryFun6261,what flavor makes beer enjoyable,"before i start, i'm pretty new to beer, so while i understand my takes may upset some beer enthusiasts, these are just my honest thoughts.

I recently started drinking more beer. Before i drank it, but i never liked it, kinda just forced myself to get it down. Now, i wouldn't say I enjoy it, but its not bad either. Idk, kinda in that neutral phase. Of course, a few beers does relax you a bit, which also makes it a bit enjoyable.

My favorite beer out of the light beers that I've had is coors light. it's carbonated, light, nothing crazy. I've also had some guiness, which didn't gross me out like some craft beers or ipas. of the few beers ive tasted, its one of my favorites so far.

so my question is, what makes people enjoy the taste of beer. Of course, its an acquired taste, but even then. The taste itself, especially with light beers, is pretty mild. Like a can of coke has way more flavor than a bud light, i don't think anyone can really argue with that. To me, light beer tastes pretty much like nothing, with an aftertaste thats a bit bitter and malty. Thats about it. 

So you always here how people come home after work and crave a beer or something. is that the flavor thats so enjoyable to them? I'm sure higher quality craft beers have more flavor and nuance.

At what manufacturing date would you all suggest i don't buy from? 

So for example if i look at some beers and the box says it's been 3 months since bottled is that old? OR do some beers travel better/keep their luster longer? Sorry if my question doesn't make sense i don't know how to word it properly.",beer
277,t3_w3dvli,LongIsland1995,American craft pilsners,"I tend to enjoy craft pilsners, some more than others. I rarely dislike them but some are a bit disappointing because they either have an IPA tier hoppiness or are too floral. I used to like Coney Island Mermaid Pilsner a lot, but I wasn't as into it last time. Not sure if they changed the formula to make it hoppier or my tastes changed over the years. 

I welcome innovation and don't think these need to taste exactly like a classic German or Czech Pilsner. But prefer that they don't try too hard to be typical ""loud"" American craft beers. 

What are some American pilsners you'd recommend?",beer

However, when it comes to session drinking I have often chosen German Pilsners and Lagers. Think Becks, Bitburger, Lowenbrau, Warsteiner, Wernsgruner and what have you... These are great, and I may do it again. But as a change up I would like other suggestions for session beer that taste great. You know how you can get those good tasting beers but by your 3rd or 4th beer you think to yourself ""this taste is getting old!"". I dont want to run into that problem.

I do like IPA, stout, Ale, Pilsners, Hefeweisse. I think my least liked ""good beers"" are the double and triple abbey ales like Duval, Unibroue stuff like La Fin Du Monde. I dont mind one or two but I really sont like super champagney and excessively carbonated beer. Keep in mind by day 3 these beers may be getting fairly close to room temperature and if you know one thing...IPA taste like SHIT when its almost warm.

I was thinking of session IPA's for night 1. Lagers and Ales for night 2. Heffeweisse for night 3 and stouts for the end of the week...I dont know what it is but I dont mind and can handle stouts at room temperature.

When people refer to Guinness Draught as being ""too thick"". It actually feels very thin to me. I think a lot of people just need to expand their palate beyond Bud Light.

Breweries trimming their non-IPA offerings (RIP Sam Adams Boston ale). I get that breweries are going to make whatever sells best (hazy IPAs at the moment I'm guessing) but there's are so many styles that I would personally rather buy.

Craft breweries selling 19.2 ounce cans. I'd happily pay a little extra for a proper 24 ounce can.

Beer snobs automatically looking down on macro beers. I spent 12 years drinking craft (and will continue to do so) but I still love Budweiser and Coors Banquet, which are much more affordable to me.

Budweiser: I actually love it and think it's the most ""beer"" tasting beer you can find. Classic American beer and pretty affordable if you get it in bulk. It gets a lot of hate on here but I don't care, I love it.

Coors Banquet: Gets a lot of praise on here so I won't go too much into it, but it's one of my favorite beers ever even not factoring in the price. Still pretty affordable and so enjoyable to drink.

Miller High Life: A little overrated IMO, has too much of a corn grit taste for my liking

PBR: I used to hate it due to it not tasting very clean, but I've warmed up to it. It does have a very noticeable white wine note that took some getting used to.

Busch: Really more of a light beer in terms of calories and alcohol (114, 4.3%). It has a slight grainy taste and overall I enjoy it.

Hamm's: Probably the cheapest beer on the market and actually pretty good. Apparently it's similar recipe as PBR, but definitely tastes different to me (doesn't have that wine taste, thankfully). I enjoy it a lot and wish it were sold here in New York!

Yuengling: Pretty good and has a bit more going on than the typical BMC beer, I just wish it were sold in brown bottles instead of green

Gennessee: Pretty affordable, nothing special but I do enjoy it. Sweet and relatively low in alcohol (4.5%)

National Bohemian: I was drinking this a lot in Ocean City, not bad at all for a budget beer.

Of course I didn't drink the gallon of beer instantly, but did within a period of 35-45 minutes. It might not have been a full gallon because of the foam and whatnot, but it was 2 Canadian pitchers (at a bar).

A bar near me sells pitchers for 15$ so I usually go here.
I jogged a bit and never felt such a weird feeling in my stomach, especially because the alcohol hadn't really kicked in yet.
I was mostly afraid of water poisoning. I drank it on for the most part and empty stomach.
I don't do this often, I'm not a big drinker now a days but at the time when I drank the two pitchers I drank that much because 1 pitcher didn't seem to really do it.

More recently, those up in ABV, like The Hairy Eyeball and Fire &amp; Eisbock, have also been revelations for me. 

When I analyzed some of my favorites, descriptors like ""dry"", ""nutty"" and ""light"" often came up. I could easily stick to those styles listed above, but also know that even within the same categories, you can get very different results (for example, I loved Boont Amber Ale, but wasn't impressed with Ruedrich's Red Seal Ale; too sweet for my liking).

487,t3_vmaxbb,Youvitiva,First All Grain Brew is in the fermenter,"Did my first all grain brew today. I did a Verdant IPA recipe by David Heath that I converted into normal measurements , substituted a couple of grains that he used that I couldn't get at my LHBS, and upped the hops amounts minimally.  


I used my new Brewzilla 3.1.1 and am favorably impressed with it's operation. I set it up last night to come on at 530 this morning to begin heating the strike water to 156. When I got up at 6, it was already at 120, so I switched it to manual from there on. Around 630, I began to mash in. It really felt weird to me stirring the grains, especially the ones at the bottom where they were thick, but I had never done it before and had no idea what it should feel like. After a few minutes of stirring, chopping motions (up and down) with the paddle, and using the paddle like a shovel to lift grains from the bottom to the top, I felt I should be good to go. I did stir in three handfuls of rice hulls, just in case, as there was 1.5 pounds of oats in the grist. I was unable to check the mash PH, as my wife's PH meter that she used to use for making cheese decided to not work today. Brewfather was pretty much right on with all the rest of it's calculations, and it calculated my to be 5.49, so as long as that is close, I should be OK. I set the temp to maintain the 149 degree temperature and then I put the top plate in place and started the recirculation for the mash. At first, I tried to keep the water level low on the top plate, but after 10 minutes or so I thought I should turn the pump up a bit and raise the level because by my logic (could be totally wrong, IDK), having a higher wort level on the top plate would exert a little more downward force, resulting in the little bit higher flow through the grain bed. All went well for the remainder of the mash. At the end of the 60 minutes, I raised the temperature to 170 for mashout. I forgot to measure how long the BZ took to get there, but it wasn't long. During the mash, I had heated my sparge water in the kitchen using the kettle I had been using for extract brewing. I was concerned about lifting the mash pipe out due to the weight on my extremely f'ed up shoulders, but not to worry it was actually easy to lift out. It drained quickly, and the entire sparge (only 2 gallons) only took like 5 minutes. I removed the malt pipe and put it in a clean food grade bucket, not expected the roughly one quart of wort that drained into there (I thought it was finished). Not a problem, it was a clean bucket, so into the kettle it went. Pre-boil gravity was 1.044 when it should have been 1.046. I'll take it. Raising the temp to a boil took a bit, but not overly long. There was a small amount of grain particulate in the wort, but really not very much. The BZ got the wort to a pretty decent boil, not violent, but pretty good, about right where I would try to set my extract batches. I put 10 drops of fermcap s in right before the start of the boil, and the hot break was a total non issue. The boil and additions were totally textbook, no problems. 10 minutes before the end of the boil, I put on the whirlpool arm and put the chiller in to sanitize them. I used a inexpensive pond pump off of amazon in a bucket of ice water to chill. I was supposed to be using a cooler instead, but the cooler was leaking (it's been years since it has been used for anything other than to keep smoked pork butts hot while they rest after cooking). Cooling down to the hop stand temperature took only a couple of minutes. I turned off the chiller and left the whirlpool running for the hop stand, then fired up the chiller again to further cool. I forgot to take off the blanket and I'm sure that hurt my cooling a bit, note to self for next time, but I was only able to cool to about 105 before I was totally out of ice....oh well, I just put it into the fermenter and into the mini-fridge at 60 degrees to further chill to pitch temperature. After I was done chilling as much as I could, I carefully removed the chiller, then whirlpooled for another 5 minutes, then let it settle for 10 to try to get the hop sludge to cone up on the false bottom. Quantity to fermenter was 5.20 and OG was 1.050 (supposed to be 1.052). Again, I'll take it. I used the pump to put the wort into the fermenter and I placed a sanitized 200 micron paint strainer bag in my fermenter bucket because I wanted to see how much crap got past the false bottom and into the fermenter. I had intended to take a picture of it, but there was nothing to take a picture of. I am TOTALLY impressed with the false bottom in the BZ.  


Lessons learned:

  
1. Check/be aware of equipment statuses before brew day (Ph meter and cooler)  
2. I need better tubing for my chiller. What I have is thin walled silicone and it kinks/flattens out way to easy, obstructing flow.  
3. I harvest ice from my fridges ice maker and put it in a plastic bag, then store it in the porch freezer until needed. I need to harvest more and will also be freezing a \*\*\*\* ton of cool/freeze packs that I have to add as well. Will be buying another cooler which will give more volume for ice water as well. Don't know if I'll be able to reach pitch temp or not (of course, by the time I was chilling, it was close to 100 ambient temperature, so there is that.",beer

512,t3_vjrwub,SurfaceThought,Feeling irrationally sad that my favorite brewery isn't making my favorite beers anymore.,"I don't even know why I am making this post, other than I want to commiserate with some people that might understand the way in which I am feeling overly dramatic about this.

Growing up in CO, Odell was always my favorite brewery. They specialized, for a very long time, in a standard lineup of reinterpreted classic english ale styles.

Over time, they became known for specializing in hop forward beers, with their IPA (I still remember when it was released) being one of the first ""big"" IPA's in the Colorado seen, back before the IPA arms race (or, I guess, in the very beginning).

For a moment in time there, they had such a beautiful line up of beers -- 

* 5 barrel, the perfect regular ass pale ale. Drinkable with the perfect amount of hop bitterness. Great all year round, mid day or late night.
* Cutthroat, a great porter, not super dark, not super high alcohol, just a good classic dark beer.
* Special Red/Runoff IPA (always was seasonal) a great red IPA that wasn't crazy on the hops and had a good malt character to balance the hops out with.
* Original IPA -- Big, aggressive, a little higher in ABV but still drinkable. IMO a great example of what this style of IPA should be without being too over the top.
* Saint Lupulin -- My favorite beer of all time. An experimental ""extra pale ale"" that had distilled hop extract added at the end, giving it an ultra dry hoped character with tones of floral terpene character and relatively low bitterness with a very crisp and clean malt character.
* Levity (this one has been gone a while now) -- honestly, this really wasn't a great beer in the technical sense probably (who knows its been so many years at this point), but I remember it as anj easy breezy biscuity light ale that was great for day drinking
* Loose leaf -- a great session ale, I think this one might have sort of replaced levity in the conceptual sense, although it was more of a pale ale than the light amber ale levity was.

The only one of these still being produced is the original IPA. If you go look at their page, almost every single beer is some experimental, trying to keep up with the jonses type of IPA, or some sort of fruited/flavored sour (sours? Seems so odd for a classically english style oriented brewery to get into, particularly when that was traditionally more of New Belgiums territory and Funkwerks is a truly great sour beer brewery in town)

They still make 90 shilling, which is a fine amber ale, and their wheat beer and I Guess their oktoberfest in fall which is good. But for the most part I have seen them discontinue all my favorite beers of theirs, one by one.

And, man... Its not just unfortunate, I feel like... sort of \*crushed\* by it. Like I always assumed I would have 5 barrel as a go to when I was younger. It literally feels like there's a piece of me missing.",beer

566,t3_vg0c84,StixandSton3s,I‚Äôve just seen somebody rank cheap US beers so thought I‚Äôd do a blind taste test with what we get in the uk (cans),"1. San Miguel
2. Carlsberg Export
3. Heineken
4. Coors
5. Estrella
6. Amstel
7. Carling
8. Coors (edit for) Light
9. Moretti
10. Corona
11. Desperados
12. Old Speckled Hen
13. Ashfield
14. Stella Artois
15. Budweiser
16. Carlsberg
17. Fosters
18. Kronenburg

So obviously this is not as expected. The carling finished much higher than I thought it would, especially above corona which was shockingly low. Having said that, some of these beers are made for bottles like Heineken and Corona. Also could‚Äôve included Madri and Sol for bottles which I imagine would‚Äôve finished very high up.

The expected ones for me were Fosters and Kronenburg which I‚Äôve always hated, Carlsberg Export is surprisingly nice given how poor its counterpart ranked. The gap between Heineken and Amstel is something I‚Äôm unsure about. Is it because the brewer is quite so good or because the difference between the two is minimal? The former is encouraging but the latter makes Heineken seem like a rip off given its supposed premium quality. 

Unfortunately overall I‚Äôd have to rank Coors and Carling as the two best beers when considering price as well. Controversial I know but the blind taste test DOES NOT LIE!

Love ‚Äòem (I did have a wildly questionable blue one recently but it was still tasty). They do a yearly release of a ‚Äòcinnamon prost‚Äô white stout that hits perfectly. Not too cinnamon-y, not too sweet, but very tasty. Their general lineup of IPAs won‚Äôt disappoint the enthusiast. Still many for me to try. Their mainline k√∂lsch (Della) is a phenom traditional brew (though I think I still fall on the Dovetail side of things for this kind of beer locally).

**What brings me here**: I still haven‚Äôt had the krampus stout or any variants. Is there anyone here that has enjoyed it and would like to share their opinions? Not sure how much of krampus is hype vs true goodness. I‚Äôve enjoyed a few of the Maplewood special cuppa releases if that‚Äôs a good ref. Is it worth trying to nab cans when they do the release?

682,t3_v6bdpg,Hipp013,Is it possible to buy the actual European version of European beers in the US? (read more for details),"*For context, when I say ""European"" and ""American"" versions, I don't necessarily mean there are two different formulations; specifically I mean the true original form of the beer you'd find in Europe (e.g. 330ml) vs. the same beer you'd find in America (e.g. 11.2 fl oz).*

---

So a few months ago I traveled to Brussels, and while I was there I fell in love with a little lady named [Delirium Tremens](https://www.delirium.be/themes/custom/delirium/assets/img/beers/beer_delirium_tremens.png). In my opinion it's got the perfect balance of sweet, bitter and carbonation that makes it ideal for any occasion. I bought two 4-packs and brought them home to the US with me, and since those ran out I've been able to find them at various liquor stores here in the States. 

The problem is, like with many imported European beers I've tried, I've found that the ""American"" version is much more carbonated than the true European version. My thought is either this has to do with needing to preserve the beer's original taste over the longer distance and time necessary for importing, or it's a result of the beer being stored for longer over that duration. Regardless, I much prefer the original carbonation factor of the true European version. (If I had to describe the difference in layman's terms, the carbonation in the European version feels much more ""foamy"", as in the bubbles physically feel smaller and more dispersed across the tongue, whereas the carbonation in the American imported version feels much more ""fizzy"", i.e. the carbonation feels more sharp and overpowering.)

&amp;nbsp;

So I actually have two questions, one general and one specific:

1. General question: Is there an actual difference in the carbonation between European beers and those same beers that are imported to America? If so, what is the reason for this?

2. Specific question: Is there a way American consumers can purchase the true original European version of imported European beers (i.e. volume denoted by ml instead of fl oz)? And I don't mean in terms of specific stores, but more-so does the ability exist?


I know of several places like World Market that specialize in imported goods, and imported beers sold at those places may or may not be denoted in ml instead of fl oz, but I am not sure if the difference in carbonation in the European vs. American versions is due to differences in the ways the beers are actually produced, or if it has to do with the fact that the beer is imported and inherently sits in storage/transportation for longer, causing the carbonation to change. In other words, if the difference is due to the latter, then maybe there would be no difference in taste between the 330ml and 11.2 fl oz versions simply due to the fact that both had to spend additional time in transit to the US.

Relevant details below:

* Location: I'm based in Chicago, so I have easy access to Binny's.
* Budget: $2.50 per 12 oz can/bottle.
* Point of clarification: I mean Belgian-style beer, NOT actually imported from Belgium.
* Beers I like (some of these depend on the season): Blue Moon (seriously, it's a tasty and balanced brew), Namaste, Tripel (Allagash), Le Tub (Whiner Beer), Milk Stout Nitro (Left Hand), White Russian Nitro (Left Hand), Vera (Around the Bend), Abt 12 (St. Bernardus), Hell or High Watermelon (21st Amendment),
* Beer styles I don't like: IPAs, lagers, brown ales, and most German beers (except for Weissbier). I hate bitter flavors and am not a fan of hops. I also like boozy flavors to be well-hidden (everything I've tried from AleSmith Brewing was a drain pour).
* Beer flavors I like: strong malts (mostly in the winter season), fruity, citrusy, spicy (as in spices: clove, coriander, etc), yeast/bread.

A Witbier in the 6-8% range would be amazing. Or if Allagash Tripel was dialed down to about a 6.5%, that would be perfect.

Great Lakes Brewing Edmund Fitzgerald porter. Better than sam Adams, but still not enjoyable.

I asked the bartender which one was more on the bitter end, and he said that neither one really was, that they were both in the modern style and not very bitter. And that started me thinking about how when IPAs started taking off, they were on the bitter side, to the point that there started to be an arms race to see how bitter brewers could make them. (It reminded me of the hot sauce arms race.) But now that's flipped such that some beers labeled ""IPA"" have barely any bitterness at all.

Don't get me wrong, I love a good juicy IPA, but I also love the bitter kind and would hate to see it disappear. But my question is: why are the hazy/juicy IPAs called ""IPAs"" in the first place? Is there some similarity in brewing technique?

I didn't think very much of it. I was just kind of wishing out loud that I could have some again. 

Fast forward til today. I get off work and she's waiting for me at my house. I come inside and talk with her a second and she tells me that she got us a Juggernaut Mystery Tackle Box (we both like to bass fish). I was super excited. I immediately went to open it and see what was inside. 

We went through all the lures and hooks in the box and I was beyond happy and thankful. She then turned to me and said ""What was that alcohol you said you liked the other day?""

 I was actually puzzled because I had forgot what we talked about. She then said ""you know the beer you said you wanted but couldn't find?"" 

I said ""Killian's."" She then said "" I hope I got the right thing. I got the Irish Red. ""

I said ""yes! That is it!""

So she went to a neighboring state and went to three different stores to find the Killian's! She's the best.

From there we have two free days before we need to return to Munich. Our initial thought was to spend them in Pilsen since it's so close, and it seems important to visit Pilsner Urquell being so close! However, Prague is certainly much larger, is very lovely, and only a little farther away. 

So the question is how to spend those two days? Our itinerary isn't *entirely* beer driven (just mostly) so cultural sites - abound in Prague, of course - are also of interest. With such a short time it seems silly to spend a day in Pilsen followed by just one day in Prague. So perhaps the real quandary is whether to spend the two days in Pilsen or Prague? Two days seems too little for Prague so my inkling is to save that for another trip later on and spend the two days in Pilsen.

Here's what I can say:

* My favorite by far was the IPA. The person who helped me decide what to get said they didn't like them because they're trendy (unless I misunderstood them), but since it's all new to me, what do I care if it's trendy or not? I was going based on my taste preferences with no regard to trends. 
* What I liked about the IPA was what I believe was the flavor of the hops. The only way I could describe the taste was floral, somewhat citrusy, piney, and the only way I could describe it is tasting like an ""crisp autumn morning after a rain,"" which I realize is pretentious AF and kind of meaningless but is what came to mind when tasting it. What I also liked about this particular IPA was that I did not notice any real bitterness. What I didn't like about the Guinness Stout was that it was a bit too bitter for me.
* Similarly, I tried a Weissbier and an Amber Ale that were also not so bitter, and liked those.
* **Where are you?** I will be in northern New Jersey, but working in New York City. 
* **What flavors do I already like?** As I said above, that non-bitter piney / floral / citrus / ""autumn breeze"" flavor was awesome. Aside from that, I like drinks to have that acidity and sweetness- if I drink wine, it's only Moscato, I like to get a latte if I get a coffee, the tea I like best is Earl Grey since the bergamot gives it that hint of sweetness. In terms of food, I like sourdough a lot which I know beer can have similar flavors to. I also don't like the taste of alcohol.
* **How much do I want to spend?** I'd ideally like to stay within the &lt;$7 per bottle range, but don't know if that's possible. I know it's possible where I currently am, but not sure elsewhere.
* **How much alcohol do I want?** I'd stay under 6% ideally. I don't like the feeling of being drunk so am drinking beer because I actually like it, so don't want to feel drunk from it.",beer

Also I wanted to just try buying a keg because I've never really used a keg.

Regardless, our province's beer is mostly sold by a shop called ""The Beer Store"" and I believe it's government owned and operated. Calculating the quantity a Keg would give rather than bottles, for the most part it averages out to around $40 more expensive for a keg than buying boxes of bottles of beer.

Everything's tasting great, but when the beer gets out, there's absolutely zero head in sight- just a few tiny bubbles around the sides of the glass and a faint wisp of white in the middle.

I don't know if this applies to everyone, but I personally love a nice foamy head, and I especially look forward to it when I'm out getting draft beers, so it's always crushing whenever I get a pint glass that looks like I might as well be drinking flat iced tea without the ice. I still finished the Sapporo, of course- I don't want to waste money or be that asshole who sends his beer back over something so small- but I do feel like headless beers taste worse, too.

Corona is awesome however it often has a skunk aroma.

Modelo is a solid rival however does not go down as smoothly as Pacifico. Modelo has higher ABV however it heavier and less crisp.

I tried a craft option named after ‚ÄúSublime‚Äù that was damn good but no Pacifico.

Pacifico dressed with fresh lemon and Mediterranean Sea Salt is heaven. It‚Äôs so crushable it provides the perfect buzzzzzz.

I even get headaches that same evening and the mornings feel absolutely terrible. Even after 6 bottles I had a terrible hangover, while normally, with proper beer, that wouldn't do anything.

I often bring my own beer when a friend serves this trash, but I was wondering if there is anything I can do to minimalize the headaches, so I don't have to go through the hassle this weekend of drinking different from everyone else. Like vitamine supplements or drinking a lot of water in-between for example.

969,t3_uluj58,sonar_y_luz,Anybody else tired of disengenuous beer marketing?,"""Roasted notes of toffee and chocolate and caramel malt etc...""

Malt is what the yeast eat to make the alcohol. It has little to no impact on flavor. Your beer tastes like beer, not toffee. Unless they are dumping malt powder in the finished product it's not going to taste ""malty"" just my 2 cents. I've never had a beer and thought""wow that tastes just like bread!"" It does smell bread like while brewing but that's where it ends. I also find 95% of the reviews on sites like beeradvocate to be hilarious in how people try to describe the flavor of beer.. you'd think they are drinking a dessert with how some of them are described....",beer
