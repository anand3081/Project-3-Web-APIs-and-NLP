I ordered a bottle of Sancerre off the menu. My server then returned and told me that they actually were out of that bottle and the sommelier was going to come by to help me pick something different. The somm came by, and actually told me they just got a different bottle of **Sancerre** in and he would bring me that one. When he brought over the wine, I noticed he actually brought over a Pouilly-Fum√©. I didn't say anything because I really enjoy both wines and think they are extremely similar, just was curious if this was a bad move by the somm or on my part. I was charged the same price as the sancerre was listed.",wine

11,t3_wmn9un,GailWynandd,Questions about decanting,"I have browsed this sub and learned the following:

Young red wines will almost always benefit from decanting and should be poured quickly from bottle into decanter.

Old red wines should not be decanted but here is where I am confused since people also say that the purpose of decanting is to seperate residue that has built up on the ground of the bottle. I assume young bottles dont have that residue and it only builds up over time with old bottles?

I have reds from 2017-2019 and am wondering if that is considered young or older? Was planning on opening the cork and pouring one fresh glass, then pouring the rest of the bottle into the decanter and see how it develops.",wine

21,t3_wmp0j1,JAHwise_0388,Shipping wines from Italy to US questions?,"So I am planning to travel to Italy soon and scheduling to visit a few wineries. My initial plan was to possibly have a few cases shipped back to the states.
I contacted Mail Boxes Etc. in Lucca and they quoted me 269‚Ç¨ per case! I‚Äôve read a few people recommend them and cited a lower price (around 140‚Ç¨/case) so I thought the quote I received was quite high. I don‚Äôt know if this is a result of inflation and post covid consequences or maybe just this specific office, and should maybe ask around to other offices of theirs? 
Kinda throws a wrench in my plans. However I have also read some wineries are able to ship direct and could also include some cases from other wineries if buying from them as well? Not sure how to handle that, if so.

I‚Äôm thinking to maybe see who the importers are for the wineries I visit and just buy stateside if possible, however I may be limited in vintage selection or possibly pay comparable prices to handling shipping myself? 

Any advice and input would be great, thanks",wine

34,t3_wlz308,Boots_the_Cat,Report on Trip to Tain-L'Hermitage,"This trip report is a follow up from the [Northern Rh√¥ne Producer Request](https://www.reddit.com/r/wine/comments/vxf1vu/northern_rh%C3%B4ne_producer_suggestions/) post.   I greatly appreciate all the recommendations users made in that post. I had an amazing day that I will never forget. I tasted 20 different wines, some outstanding, some meh, and one absolutely terrible.

The day began with a four-hour train ride train to Tain-L'Hermitage. I failed at making reservations for anything other than a room at the Hotel 2 Coteaux, and I had try my luck walking into tasting rooms. I got into Tain at 10:30 AM, with the majestic Hermitage Hill dominating the skyline as soon as I got off the train.

[Hermitage Hill from the Train Station](https://preview.redd.it/qqw8mjr2m4h91.jpg?width=2016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f42641e698b6a265a9527e8a1c59283e721e3309)

My first stop was **Ferraton P√®re &amp; Fils** (owned by Chapoutier). Appointments are recommended, but I was lucky and able to start a tasting right away.  The wine quality varied, but I had a great guide for the tasting. He detailed the different Rhone appellations as he poured and gave me a lot of very interesting information and anecdotes. We had a great time chatting about our lives, and I got to try a broad range of Ferraton's offerings:

* **2021 Ferraton Saint Peray Le Mialan**
   * 100% Marsanne grown on limestone and granite. Citrusy and peach notes hit you right out of the gate with a minerality after that quickly fades. A bit of effervescence detectable, which surprised me. Very refreshing and not at all what I have had before with a Marsanne.
* **2020 Ferraton Saint Joseph Blanc La Source**
   * 100% Marsanne grown on granite soils. Round mouthfeel with defined minerality and then the floral and lightly honeyed notes you expect in Marsanne. More rounded, due to more oak than Saint Peray but lacked the freshness I loved in the Saint Peray.
* **2020 Ferraton Crozes-Hermitage Blanc La Matiniere**
   * 100% Marsanne grown on limestone. I found it a bit bland.  It lacked the freshness and acidity I liked about the Saint Peray and didn't have even the limited depth of the Saint Joseph.
* **2019 Ferraton Hermitage Blanc Les Miaux**
   * 100% Marsanne grown on plots on Hermitage hill with clay and limestone soil with round pebbles at surface and some granite soils. The polar opposite of the Saint Peray, but it tied as my favorite Ferraton blanc with the S Peray.  Very complex on the palate with notes of pear, peach and other stonefruit, as well as honey and light touch of oak noticeable. Will likely deepen and round out nicely in a few years.
* **2019 Ferraton Hermitage Blanc La Reverdy**
   * 50% Marsanne and 50% Roussane from le Meal (limestone and alluvial) and les Beaumes (round pebbles) plots. It was bigger and had a more rounded mouthfeel with more evident oak than the les Miaux blanc. I prefer lighter oak in whites and liked the subtleness of the Miaux blanc more.
* **2020 Ferraton Crozes-Hermitage Rouge Les Picheres**
   * 100% Syrah on limestone with pebbles on surface. Bit of light cherry and black fruit notes and not much else. I found this bland and lacking.
* **2019 Ferraton Cornas Lieu-det Patou**
   * 100% Syrah on granite slopes. Very grippy tannins at this young age that will likely subside. Very good black fruit notes with a good light barnyard funk. Very elegant structure that also had power. It was my favorite of the Ferraton rouge.
* **2017 Ferraton Saint Joseph Rouge**
   * 100% Syrah on steep granite slopes. Bright cherry notes most evident and strong tannins. Not bad, but less elegant and structured than the Cornas and lacked the funk I like.
* **2016 Ferraton Hermitage Rouge Les Miaux**
   * 100% Syrah from les Dionieres (alluvial with pebbles at surface) and le Meal (round pebbles) plots. Black fruit notes most evident without much else to speak of, and only faintest hints of the leather, funk, or smoked meat I was looking for. This was the first actual Hermitage I've ever tasted, and I was disappointed. It was a big wine but lacked the powerful but complex structure I expected.
* **2018 Ferraton Cote Rotie Lieu-dit Montmain**
   * 100% Syrah on micashistes and granite soils. Very elegant with restrained yet grippy tannins. Good mix of red and black fruit notes with earthy and floral undertones evident. Very elegant structure.

I ended up purchasing one bottle of each of my three favorites: the 2021 Saint Peray Le Mialan, the 2019 Cornas Lieu-det Patou, and the 2019 Hermitage Blanc Les Miaux.

After **Ferraton**, I went and got lunch at cafe **La Nice** overlooking the Rhone. While there I had a glass of Crozes-Hermitage blanc:

* **2019 Olivier Dumanie La Croix du Verre Crozes-Hermitage Blanc**
   * 80% Roussane and 20% Marsanne on light colored clay soil. Bright stone fruit, honey, and floral notes made for a very refreshing glass at lunch in the hot weather. I paired it with a burger and fries, which went surprisingly well.

[Burger with Olivier Domaine Crozes-Hermitage Blanc at La Nice](https://preview.redd.it/bywasudfm4h91.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e623dd1a0fa7f69a1cb9ebe6683f5157d47aff3)

After lunch, I walked to the respected Northern Rhone co-op **Cave de Tain** and signed up for the 3:30 PM tour. Having about few hours to kill, I went to **Maison Chapoutier** in Tain, which turned out to be mostly just a wine shop. I asked if a tasting was available and was told ""only if I intended to purchase a few bottles.""  As my wine purchases were limited to what I could carry home on the train and I can find almost all Chapoutier wines easily where I live in the USA, I quickly moved on.

Still having time to kill, I went to **Marius Bistro** in the Chapoutier-owned Fac &amp; Spera Hotel.  They had a fantastic cellar and by-the-glass list, and I had a glass of Hermitage Blanc:

* **2018 Chapoutier Hermitage Chante-Alouette**
   * 100% Marsanne from le Meal (alluvial with pebbles at surface), les Murets (clay-gravel), and Chante-Alouette (loess and granite). Very complex on the palate, with pear, apricot, honey, and floral notes quite evident. Very well rounded and full textured. Very light oak notes that didn't overpower. My favorite blanc of the trip.

[2018 Chapoutier Hermitage Chante-Alouette](https://preview.redd.it/2ra090wlm4h91.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b00e334b78fd781b5088e176e46d452781508ee)

After finishing the glass of hermitage blanc, I returned to **Cave de Tain** for the tour. I soon learned that the entire tour was in French. Unfortunately, I do not speak French. English tours are apparently only on Tuesdays.  As I was already there, I decided to join the tour anyway. There were a few English language signs, and I already know enough about wine production to mostly know what I was looking at.  The tour took us through the full production process, including the stainless steel fermenting tanks, the new concrete tanks, their barrel-filled cellars, and their bottle vault. The highlight for me was seeing the Hermitage vin de paille barrels and their back vintages in the vault. The tour ended with a tasting of the basic Cave de Tain wines:

* **2020 Cave de Tain Saint Peray**
   * Marsanne and Roussane (couldn't find percentages) on limestone soils. Bright and refreshing with citrusy and peach notes, but not complex or crisp as the Ferraton Hermitage blancs.
* **2020 Cave de Tain Crozes-Hermitage Blanc**
   * 100% Marsanne on varied pebbly alluvial and granite soils. Good mix of stone fruit and floral notes with a very slight effervescence. It was fine, but did not stand out among blancs tasted during my trip.
* **2019 Cave de Tain Crozes-Hermitage Rouge**
   * 100% Syrah on varied pebbly alluvial and granite soils. Red fruit was prevalent, but tannins and acidity were both too low. Overall it lacked complexity and was very meh.
* **2019 Cave de Tain Saint Joseph Rouge**
   * 100% Syrah on granite. Bold tannins, black fruit forward with a bit of barnyard funk, light game notes, hint of smoked meat and leather, with a touch of earthiness at the end. This was my favorite wine of tasting. Beautiful complexity and mix of power and elegance.
* **2017 Cave de Tain Hermitage Rouge**
   * 100% Syrah from plots with granite and pebbly alluvial soils. Bold and in your face like I expected from Hermitage. Notes of black fruit, barnyard funk, game, smoked meat. Similar to the Saint Joseph but with more pronounced notes, more power, and less elegance. Great Hermitage rouge for me.

[Barrel-Aging Vin de Paille](https://preview.redd.it/jlkppq89p4h91.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cf2d1a3ff0456cc61edcbd15dcce14fb2673f78)

I bought a few bottles of the higher-tier versions of the Saint Joseph and Hermitage rouge: two bottles of the 2015 Cave de Tain Saint-Joseph Espirit de Granit Rouge and one bottle of the 2015 Cave de Tain Hermitage Gambert de Loche Rouge. I was tempted to pick up a vin de paille, as they had an incredible library of back vintages for sale, but my budget was a bit constrained.

After the tour and a rest in my room, I had dinner at **Cage des Fleurs** in Tain\*\*,\*\* where I had a fantastic meal with the best and worst wines of the trip.

* **2020 Vignerons Ardechois Viognier IGP**
   * 100% Viognier. Very in your face cloying sweetness followed by tropical fruit notes with a bit of peach and apricot. The waitress warned me it was sweet, but I hadn't had viognier yet on the trip, so i got it anyway. Awful sweet fruity wine that was offensive to my palate. Easily the worst wine of the trip. It also paired awfully with mustard gravlox amuse bouche. I didn't finish much of it.
* **2019 Yves Cuilleron Saint Joseph Les Serrine**
   * 100% Syrah on granite soils. Very smooth silky tannins. Fresh bright black and red fruit notes, with earthiness and light tobacco notes and a good mineral finish. A well put together complex and beautiful Saint Joseph. After the viognier fiasco, I picked this from the fantastic bottle list.  Wine of the trip for me. Paired beautifully with the monkfish main course and a local cheese plate for dessert.

[The Offensive Viognier with Gravlox](https://preview.redd.it/lgsbpsarp4h91.jpg?width=1512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8014f4b74e73fd5febad6ab2e1515f2b280b5ef4)

I called it a night after **Cage de Fleurs.** I had plans the next morning to hike Hermitage Hill and visit Vineum Paul Jaboulet Aine for a tasting and lunch.  However, I ended up scrapping that in favor of heading home early the next day.  It had been very hot the entire day, with temperatures nearing 100F (37C), and the next day promised to be just as hot if not hotter. Realizing I would be lugging a heavy bag home via train and I would get a chance to come back later in the year, I decided just to leave early in the morning to beat the heat.

**Conclusion:** I was very happy with what I accomplished in less than 24 hours in Tain. The quality of the wines varied, but I only had one glass I found offensive. I have a lengthy to-do list for my next visit in November, when I will again be in the area for work. I didn't get a chance to try or buy a Hermitage vin de paille, and I will need to visit the Jaboulet Vineum. I will have a car and an extra day next time, and I plan to venture outside of Tain and try to visit a few cellars in other regions in the Northern Rhone, with Yves Cuilleron being high on my list. If this post gets a decent reception, I will post about that trip as well. This is my first detailed post, so writing critiques welcome.

Also, I highly recommend Hotel 2 Coteaux. It's on the bank of the Rhone in the center of Tain. Great comfortable rooms for under EUR 100 a night with a great breakfast. I'll be staying there again in November.",wine

At the nose there‚Äôs a toasty/brioche and somewhat fruity (zest, tropical) note, along with some sweet hint of cocoa. The taste is what I was expecting, like the 08 I had the brioche, burnt smokey wood taste was there, but it being a rose it has an elegant way of combining that with a nice fruit (peach, strawberry) note. I was overall very happy with this but honestly the regular Dom vintages are amazing, it‚Äôs almost hard to really upgrade to one of their ros√©s.

So far, I know the tasting is  going to be a dinner with each wine paring with a dish, can you call it a tasting at that point, and then talk about the wines I think. Here is the list of wines in no order that I will be serving:

‚Ä¢ Dogliani Superiore 
‚Ä¢ Amarone Della Valpolicella Classico
‚Ä¢ Carignano from Sardinia 
‚Ä¢ Etna Bianco
‚Ä¢ Vin Santo Del Chianti Classico 
‚Ä¢ Pommard
‚Ä¢ Condrieu 

What order do you suggest I serve the wine and what food fo you recommend I pair it with it? We need to have the food be gluten free and keto. 

P.S. I plain on serving lamb with the Amarone.",wine
54,t3_wldpdg,zoomiewoop,Last night in St Emilion,"The four bottles we tasted on our final night in St Emilion. It‚Äôs been a lovely week here!

Clos Saint Martin 2015, St Emilion grand cru class√© 
Porte Chic 2016 Pomerol
Troplong Mondot 2011, St Emilion 1er cru B GCC
Troplong Mondot 2019, ‚Äú ‚Äú

Winners were the TM 2019 and CSM 2015. They are very different styles: Troplong Mondot, especially since its new ownership in 2017, is powerful, concentrated dark fruit; delicious; modern; pretty straightforward. Of course the 2019 is very young. Clos Saint Martin, on the other hand, which we only discovered on this trip, is exceedingly elegant on the mouth with great finesse and refinement, with notes of sweet black fruit, toffee, cloves on the nose. They‚Äôre both fantastic, and in our opinion very good value for what you get (they can both be had for about $105 or thereabouts: you may be able to find the CSM for quite a bit less, but then you may not be able to find it at all!).

Porte Chic is a strange one. All the shops in St Emilion want to recommend it as a ‚Äústarter‚Äù Pomerol (its ‚Ç¨45, which is cheaper than many Pomerol), but it didn‚Äôt impress us. Nose has plums and opulent fruit of black cherries, but it has drying tannins that aren‚Äôt well integrated and a green note, and it was a bit hard for us to appreciate. Seemed like it needed food, and a lot of air. Maybe too young?

The Troplong Mondot 2011 is also fascinating. This is from the old ownership of Christine Valette, who really built up TM, but pursued a very different style to the current management. This wine has very drying tannins and seems hard to appreciate, but if you can get past that, there‚Äôs quite a lot of elegance and interest here. In addition to the typical dark fruit berry notes for St Emilion, there are figs and Christmas mulled wine notes that are quite alluring. Absolutely needs food pairing because of the tannins. This wine changed our opinions a bit on 2011 as a vintage.

Lots of things to say about St Emilion as a place to visit but I‚Äôll save it for another post when we are back home. I don‚Äôt see many posts on wines from here which is a shame as it‚Äôs one of our favorite regions!

Complete notes are on Cellar Tracker (user name ‚ÄúBrendel‚Äù) for these and some 40+ other wines we tried here.",wine

From what I understand, Fromenteau is the name of a separate grape variety originating in Burgundy, which is an ancestor of Pinot Gris/Grigio.

But it‚Äôs also used to describe an Alsace grape, Roussane (in Rh√¥ne) and sometimes used to describe Pinot Gris/Grigio, particularly in Champagne.

But hold on a second‚Ä¶ Julien Miquel has said in a video that the Fortmenteau grown in Champagne is related but not the same as Pinot Gris. Which is contrary to what others say.

I've been drinking wine for a while now and want to get more serious about it, starting with a more methodical approach to tasting and figuring out what I like/don't like and why. I came up with this list, which is organized (correctly, I hope) light-full bodied.

My plan is to buy either one or two bottles at a time and taste, so that I'm not spending a fortune at any one time and I have the flexibility to do it on my own (though will likely invite friends sometimes). I've grouped them in the pairs that I would taste them in (or solo).

Some of these feel like ""must tries"" but I sprinkled a few in that I think just sound interesting. I'm not necessarily going to go in this order, but I might. Let me know if you think I'm missing anything!

For food we have from left to right:

- Brie with soy sauce, honey, and walnuts
- Sliced ros√© cheddar
- Feta cheese with lemon juice, garlic, and thyme
- Regular cheddar
- Roasted peanuts

I am still new to wine tasting so pardon my vague notes, but here goes!

On the nose: cherry, raspberry, moss, and a hint of blueberry.

On the palate: smoky, black pepper and wood. Medium-bodied with bold acidity. When paired with the ros√© cheddar, the acidity instantly softened down.

We experimented with the peanuts and found that eating them first helped dry out the mouth. We would then sip the Pinot and were able to taste the flavors much deeper. Overall, a very lovely and mature wine we both enjoyed.",wine

Last question - most wineries seem to offer both a tasting and also a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù version where you get a tasting and a walking tour (Most of which make the tasting in the $75+ range). Is the walking tour always worth it?

I had volunteered to bring a few bottles of wine that would compliment the food offerings. I thought I would have more time to prepare, but the host who's cooking all the food only got back to me with the menu now - it's a LOT more varied than I was expecting.

Everything sounds delicious, but now I'm feeling overwhelmed and feel like my brain is shutting down lol. Can you guys at least point me in the right direction?

There's going to be one main course with several different small plates, **all served at once**. The challenge here is **offering 3-4 different wines that can can compliment multiple offerings**, because in all likelihood, each guest will only be drinking one wine at a time with a little bit of everything on their plate.

* Lamb lollipops

* Mussels in a garlic white miso broth

* Peaches &amp; prosciutto

* Heirloom tomatoes &amp; burrata cheese

* Baked artichokes

* Napa cabbage salad

* Toasted bread

I'm thinking a Gr√ºner Veltliner or Pinot Grigio could cover the artichokes, cabbage salad, and tomatoes + burrata, and even the mussels.

A nice semi-dry Riesling could cover a few bases, maybe, including the peaches &amp; prosciutto.

And then I definitely want a full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon for the lamb lollipops.

135,t3_wiod6h,targert_mathos,Opinions on St√©phane Montez?,"Specifically his C√¥te R√¥tie and Condrieu. I don't get the hype around them. I sell a lot of his wines where I work and so many restaurants, big or small, luxurious or casual, seem to sell his wines. So many people know his wines and seem to appreciate them, even people who are not much into wine. I don't get it. 

I have done a tasting at the domaine in the past and I can say without hesitation I did not like them at all, and some of them I absolutely hated. His ""Les Grandes Places"" spends 42 months (3.5 years) in 100% new oak barrels. It's basically turning wine into whiskey at that point. It's disgusting. When you compare it to Gerin for example, their Grandes Places spends 22 months in 40% new oak and for me is a thousand times better. The Condrieu as well just smells like vanilla and wood and tastes like oak juice. 

The reason I ask is because there are very few wines that I would say are bad at that price point, and that is one of them. Yet everyone seems to like them. I think it's a case of brand recognition and believing it to be a good wine based on its popularity. But maybe I am just wrong.",wine

Comes with drama, too. ü§£

My mother gave me this bottle of sparkling white whine, to celebrate the birth of my first child.

Unfortunately, their visit to the hospital to see their grandchild was mildly dramatic, and ended with my mother leaving and refusing to talk to me. Dad, I'm afraid, had to shrug and just go with her. I appreciate my existance, but that man chose his wife very poorly.

Now I have this unopened bottle and I don't know what to do with it. My wife and I thought maybe we'd just open it and drink it down. But then, my mother did say it was an ""expensive"" bottle. Coming from her, that could mean anything though. Could be a small lie (she will often lie about the smallest and most pointless things). Or could be a bottle that I should be afraid to even hold.

Anyway. Would appreciate an expert to accurately tell me what exactly this is. If it's cheap, we'll just drink it. But if it's too expensive, then well, we will probably save it for the next time my dad visits by himself.

202,t3_wh1b7x,hurtscience,Pinot Noir - Getting Started on the Wrong Foot,"I started seriously learning about wine over the past year. Like many people who start taking a closer interest in wine, I wanted to get into Pinot Noir, mainly because of its reputation. I haven‚Äôt tried much, mainly because of the expense, but I‚Äôve tried a few domestic bottles and I‚Äôm having trouble finding something I really like as well as something that carries a lot of varietal characteristics. Most of what I know about PN‚Äôs character is from what I‚Äôve read or heard about it.

So, I reviewed the PNs I‚Äôve tried so far to see if anyone here can help me learn from my experiences and come up with some ideas for what I should try so I can get a better idea of what PN can be. To give you an idea of what my tastes are, my favorite wines right now are Chianti, Barolo, Malbec, and Garnacha/Grenache. I do like white wine, but I haven‚Äôt tried enough varietals/styles to fairly pick a favorite (I‚Äôve mostly had Chardonnay).

Disclaimer: I know that taste in wine is subjective and these are just my opinions. I don‚Äôt judge anyone who likes what I don‚Äôt like and vice versa. I am a strong believer in letting people have nice things/not being a gatekeeper. It should be noted that it has been months since I drank these and I'm going off of what I remember. Also, I definitely still consider myself a novice in the world of wine.

That said, here goes:

Elouan (2019) - I didn‚Äôt hate it but, but I didn‚Äôt love it, either. It was a much darker color than I would expect for a typical PN - very opaque. It was really smooth and had nice, round tannins, which I liked. Easy drinking. The fruitiness was more strawberry than cherry. It wasn't very complex, but that‚Äôs what you get for $20. Not a terrible value, but what I‚Äôve read about this bottle seemed to indicate that it isn‚Äôt a typical representation of PN‚Äôs varietal characteristics. I liked it just okay, but I don‚Äôt think I would go back to it anytime soon. It did make me want to try higher-quality Willamette Valley PNs, though.

Martin Ray Bootlegger‚Äôs Hill Russian River Valley (2020) - This one was disappointing. It was kind of pricey ($60 - I got it at a discount). The color looked typical for PN - lighter and more transparent than the Elouan. It fell a bit flat on the palate, though. It wasn‚Äôt particularly complex and it was a little on the bland side. It wasn‚Äôt all that memorable, so I struggle to remember what it even tasted like. I do recall a little bit of cherry and some herbaceous funk, but it tasted very watered-down. I remember having an ‚Äúeh, kind of a letdown‚Äù feeling about it while drinking it.

Flowers Russian River Valley (2020) - I absolutely hated it. Very bitter and lots of VA. I remember it being herbaceous/a little grassy on the palate with the faintest hint of cherry (mostly the acid - the fruit was basically nonexistent). I don‚Äôt think it was corked. I‚Äôve had corked wine and it wasn‚Äôt the same. It wasn‚Äôt vinegar, but I didn‚Äôt enjoy it. I would sum it up as sour dirt. I can‚Äôt think of many wines that I‚Äôve disliked more than this one.

I found it slightly sweet, jammy, bright, and smooth. I got notes of oak, spice, and and excellent dark fruit flavors.

It had a nice finish and an overall pleasant taste.

I was excited to try it but also wary due to so many reviews calling it a horrible wine. I was half expecting some overly sweet overly altered frankenwine. It's definitely not a horrible wine, in fact its quite good.

What it is IMO is overpriced. I see this bottle can go for $90 in some markets. That's outrageous. I even feel like I overspent at $70.

The reason I say this is because I've had wines just as good likely better at much lower prices. Some examples are faust, la vielle cure, and dame de gaffeliere. These can be had for $40-$50.

I recommend everyone try camus at least once, but due to its price I dont see myself being a frequent purchaser of it when I have other options that are a better cost ratio.",wine

Hello friends - a few months back you all showed a lot of appreciation for the sketch about Sangiovese I posted in this sub.

That inspired me and a couple fellow wine and data nerds to keep working on a bigger project with the idea of helping people branch out and find new/different wines they might like. So many people are caught in a rut of buying the same wines over and over again, when there is a big world out there to explore.

Here's an early/in-progress version of the idea: [https://try.vi](https://try.vi)

The idea is that you can pick a wine from the menu, and the tool will show you up to 12 wines that have some overlapping taste attributes - i.e. if you like the wine you selected, there's a good chance you'll like the other wines that are shown. It won't be right 100% of the time (wine is complicated), but it will hopefully be right more often than not. 

Right now I think it's more dialed in for reds than whites, which are a bit tricker to classify. There is more tuning to do for both, including adjusting so it doesn't show too many wines for the same general region/grape.

You can also click the buttons and the sizes of each circle will adjust, enlarging wines higher in the selected attribute - fruit, oak, price, etc.

Of course - if you have a good local wine shop or somm you trust, you don't need this, they will steer you in the right direction. But many people don't...

This is all very experimental (and I'll be the first to admit the interface is a bit klugey), but I would truly appreciate any feedback you can share - why it's helpful, why it's dumb, if you like it what features you'd like to see added, etc.",wine

I have a small cellar and only space for around 40 bottles. I like to always have a wide variety of wines in my cellar so when I feel like a certain wine, I'll have at least one or two bottles available. 

I've recently had the ""problem"" that I got overexcited about a special offer which led me to buy 12 bottles of Aussie Shiraz that fill up my cellar and block a lot of space.

To avoid this in the future, I'm thinking about allocating a fixed space for each varietal/wine type, for example (each bin = 6 bottles):

- Bin 1: Riesling

- Bin 2: Chardonnay/Pinot Grigio

- Bin 3: Other whites

- Bin 4: Champagne

- Bin 5: Syrah/Shiraz, Rh√¥ne Blends

- Bin 6: Bordeaux Blends

- Bin 7: Other reds


Basically, I'd only refill what's missing. One bin might have a higher turnover than others, but at any given time there's always a broad choice.
Has anyone used a similar system? What are your experiences?

**Background:**

I was at my local wine shop, and struck up a conversation with the gent behind the counter. Turned out it was the Sommelier that more or less runs the place. I was picking up a few bottles for gifts and a few for myself. Because I live alone, we were talking about half sized bottles, and my affinity towards them. He mentions Caymus, I tell him I've never tried it, and wouldn't want to from what I've heard. He offers me a bottle for 75% off. I say what the hell, make it 2 half bottles and ill give it a try. So I end up with 2 half bottles for about $30 CAD. oops.

I figure I might as well do this properly, so I plan my long weekend dinner around a bottle. I settled on a new york strip (sous vide and pan finished), with honey roasted carrots, roasted potatoes, roasted brussels sprouts, and quick green beans.

**The Wine:**

The biggest thing for me was to try and go into this without any bias.

I strongly dislike labels that are too busy. Give me plain Jane labels every day. I didn't mind this one.

I was surprised that the half bottle was screw top and not a cork.

First glass, look. I was surprised on how dark this wine was. My picture does not do it justice. Deep deep deep purple, almost black. Thin bright ruby rim.

First glass, nose. I picked up very little. A small hint of raspberry and black cherry, but very faint. I caught myself wondering if I was hoping there was something there.

First glass, taste. Overwhelmingly disappointing. Very little depth. I had some choke cherry, some raspberry, a hint of earthiness. Very little tannin. Very middle of the road where there was too little acid and too little tannin.

As I ate, I kept coming back to my glass, and it slowly started to open up right towards the end.

Second glass, nose. About 25 minutes from initial opening, things started to open up quite a bit. I started getting a lot more of that red fruit and earthiness. Small hint of anise.

Second glass, taste. Sour raspberries, choke cherry, leaning on the sour/tart side, and some spice started to poke through. Anise. Smoky vanilla with chocolate, almost as an afterthought.

Third glass, nose. almost 50 minutes from initial open, much more fruit up front. Chocolate and vanilla. Cherry omnipresent, no more raspberry. Earthiness stronger, but not over bearing.

Third glass, taste. Sour cherry, smoky chocolate, tart, earthiness. More (stronger) tannin now.

**The Verdict:**

I can see the appeal of this wine. I think some decanting is definitely needed, and/or let this sit in the cellar for a few years. This would be a good wine to introduce people to Cab Sauv. Very middle of the road. Not too bold, not too weak. Flavors tend to be subtle. Flavor is very much relative however, and would be curious to see how it stacks vs other Napa Cab Sauv. Not overly tannic, or acidic. This wine is not worth the $110 CAD price tag. My $30 CAD/bottle price point is much more realistic imo for what this wine is.

**Final Thoughts:**

I will never go out of my way to acquire this wine. I am glad i had the chance to experience it. If someone gave me a bottle or offered me a glass, I wouldn't turn it down. (something along the lines of my favorite red wine is free red wine, followed closely by anything but Caymus). My second bottle will most likely end up being used as a juxtaposition against another Napa cab, in the $30-50 CAD price range purely for comparison. I have a friend who seems to think retail price point is king, so perhaps I shall try to blow his preconceived notion up a little.

Maybe now I can convince my new sommelier friend to discount their Pinot Noir to something more reasonable and see how that holds up.

It is my first experience with this and I have some questions I haven't been able to find the answers to easily while searching google/reddit.

As I saw this recommended from youtube it makes me wonder if the level of reducion could differ from bottle to bottle, with one being reduced and the other not at all? I can't notice them mentioning it at all in the video.

Could it be that they've made different batches of the same vintage being and send different batches to different continents? (I live in Europe)

I've also seen people mentioning to aereate the wine, and as I've done that I've noticed that the smell has toned down but it's still very present and unpleasant, after almost 2 hours in the glass... How long is it reasonable to wait before deciding to return the bottle?

I am looking for a bottle of wine from '72 for my father's 50th birthday in a couple of weeks. Both of us are WSET Sommeliers and know our way around Italian wine (he raised me in Italy), so the wine should still be good to drink.   
Naturally, the most obvious choice would be Bordeaux, but according to friends even something as baller as a Mouton-Rothschild wouldn't necessarily be any good, with 72 being a very ordinary if not sub-par year.  
I've also given up on anything Italian, due to the Bordeaux-type Tuscan wine being a newer invention and traditional Sangiovese usually not having 50-year capability (recently tasted an '85 Brunello - it was more akin to vinegar), and any other wine from that period that could still be good (Valpolicella or Barolo) being impossible to find.

Usually our BTG reds are kept out at ""room temp,"" which behind the bar is generally around 21¬∞C (70¬∞F). In an ideal world, we would have a small cellar-temp cooler for them, but that's not currently an option space-wise.

We have a cooler for our whites/bubbles/skin contact wines set at about 3¬∞C (38¬∞F).

Our cooler for our reds BTB is about 14¬∞C (57¬∞F).

I think the white cooler is too cold, and the red cooler is too warm and far away from the bar.

Does anyone have a clever solution to keep the wine at its ideal temp? We do have stone wine chillers that are helpful, but they don't actively chill, instead they just hold the wine at temp for about an hour or so. I feel like ice baths would necessitate lots of maintenance and over-chill the wine.

Found this while exploring a local shop and thought 'now's the time!' so took the plunge. Punset is an interesting producer, making organic wine out of Nieve. This wine comes from the subzone of Basarin in Langhe. The grapes are fermented with indigenous yeasts. After a 4 week maceration, the wine is aged in large Slavonian oak barrels for at least 24 months.

Appearance: Medium garnet with some signs of age. Brick orange change at the rim. No extract in the legs. Really lovely colour.

Nose: Bright bouquet of red fruits, sour cherry and raspberries and a touch of oak in smoke and spices. No idea what a violet smells like but definitely there are some floral notes, rose.

Palate: High grippy tannins! I was quite surprised as the cheaper young Nebbiolo I've had had much softer tannins, and thought the age would have softened them further. Even today, a day later, the tannins are still grippy. Great learning for me! Lots of sour cherry flavours and some earthiness. Chalky. High acid, medium+ body, medium alcohol, medium+ length.

Conclusions: I really enjoyed this, but found it more of a learning experience than pure vinous pleasure. Traditionally made Nebbiolo needs the time everyone says it does to integrate the tannins. Now to search out something older still...",wine

I could drink the same bottle 5 times and come away with 5 different takes each time. I thought that would change over time but honestly it has not, if anything that impression has been absolutely confirmed for me.

I feel like I need to have the same bottle a good 15 times before I can really know what to expect and even then it's more like I only know the ""range"" where it will show-up but nothing more specific then that. It definitely keeps things interesting but can be frustrating when I buy a 12 bottle ""pack"" (I'm sure there's a better word for this but I can't think of it atm) for a discount and find out I actually don't really like it that much 3 bottles in, or conversely regret not buying in bulk something I grow to love before it's sold out.

Italian whites are well outside of my comfort zone, but Italian wines in general are my local guy's thing so I gave it a whirl. Man, not disappointed at all, particularly at this price point.

Beautiful golden hue. Fresh lemon zest on the nose, along with some gravel and a bit of salinity. 

For the palate, you're greeted with a tangy acidity and a subtle, citrus orange peel and lime thing. A little deeper, I'm thinking more lemon, stone fruit, maybe even a tiny bit of petrol in there. There's even this ashy minerality to it. It's quite fresh. In some ways it feels like an Alsatian Riesling, with a bit more heft body-wise, but softer on the minerality front.

This really makes me want to dig more into Italian verddichio.

We currently have 2 wine fridges (one is a 6 bottle capacity for some whites and the other is a 30ish bottle capacity). They are both full.

We are trying to find a large fridge to hold our bottles, as well as some others we have not refrigerated currently. 

I considered going with the Wine Enthusiast Classic L-150, but see mixed reviews. I've searched wine sites, wayfair, amazon, etc. and it seems there are a large variety of large fridges (over 100 bottle capacity), but seriously mixed reviews.

A couple considerations:

1) Don't want to be spending over $2,000 (ideally $1500 or less)  
2) Would like at least 100 bottle capacity  
3) Concerned as a lot of these fridges seemed to be designed for Bordeaux style wines and we have plenty of California reds, the Burgundy reds arriving, etc. So I am  concerned we will run into issues of shelves getting stuck, etc. These are really for our personal consumption, and not to flip/sell, so some label damage is not the end of the world.

I‚Äôve never used Reddit before but I found this wine community and thought I might get great advices on how to start wine collection!

I would say I know all the basics about wines, so no worries about cellaring conditions etc.

My main questions here are:
1. Where should I start (in terms of regions, styles, etc.)
2. How to pick specific producers, wines &amp; vintages

On the point 1, I don‚Äôt really have strong preference on styles of wine, so I‚Äôm hoping to purchase and collect a diverse styles of wines over the coming years. The only exception so far is probably Californian Chardonnay that‚Äôs heavily oaked (I really drink anything but I‚Äôve never liked them).

So my strategy right now is start with wines that have a particularly long aging potential like big Italian reds, Californian Cabernet, Bordeaux, German Riesling, etc.

I know these wines with long aging potential tend to be expensive so I‚Äôd probably start buying (relatively) inexpensive ones with aging potential at the same time like Australian Riesling/Semillon, Spanish Tempranillo, etc.

Does this sound like a good way to start? Any other advice on deciding where to start?

On the point 2, I would like to buy 6 to 12 bottles of the same wine and see how they age over the years, but I don‚Äôt want to buy a case of expensive wines just to find out I don‚Äôt like them enough. However, drinking 10 high end Cali Cabernet just to figure out which wine I want to buy in a case to age would cost me too much money. The best way I can think of is to go to a wine bar and taste as many as possible by glass, but by-glass selection at a bar/restaurant usually doesn‚Äôt include high end wines. Even if it does, that‚Äôs only for popular wine producing regions such as Bordeaux, burgundy and Californian Cabernet.

And there‚Äôs an issue that young wines taste so different from aged wines. I generally like wines with some age, so even if I get to taste a finest Californian Cabernet, I don‚Äôt think I enjoy it that much if it‚Äôs very young. Yet, good old wines are either expensive or not available on the market. So how can I tell, if I would like a specific bottle of wine after 10 years, without waiting for 10 years? Any good idea? I‚Äôm not experienced enough to predict how a young bottle of wine would age in next 10 and 20 years.

I was having a discussion with a  distributor a few days ago about what ""classic"" Rioja is. When speaking about Tempranillo, I think we all can understand that when we think of ""classic"" Rioja we often think of overtly oaky (american oak and long barrel time), as compared to say a more nuanced Bordeaux (french oak). He was discussing with me that at its true essence, ""classic"" Rioja is really a lot closer to Bordeaux (with the influx of Bordeaux producers during the 1850's due to phylloxera). We then tasted a great wine Conde de Hervias 'Torre del Hervias Rioja 2012' and next to it, poured a  Remelluri Reserva Rioja 2006. 

  
Both wines were outstanding, but it was obvious that the Remelluri was wayyy more like a Bordeaux than the Conde de Hervias. Could it be that it has 6 more years on it? Possibly. But I really really enjoyed that Remelluri. All this to say, I am visiting Spain soon and really want to dig into any producers that you might find produce a tempranillo that ranges closer to Bordeaux in style. I've got Ostatu and Tritium on my list so far in addition to all the usuals, but was hoping for any further professional insight.

He asked how I found him, and I mentioned the [Decanter article](https://www.decanter.com/wine-travel/france/wine-buyers-guide-to-calais-248650/) which he said is where most of his more knowledgable customers find him (""if they mention decanter I know they're into their wine"").

Note: I have absolutely zero connection to the company other than being a very satisified customer who wanted to pass on a recommendation.

I have a collection of 9 wines. Mostly red and white Burgundies, nothing older than 2016.

They are stored flat and horizontally in a wine bottle shipper, with proper packaging. 

This box is in my dining room closet. The closet gets absolutely no sunlight and little vibration from walking.

Now, the problem. I live in Los Angeles, in a smaller apartment on the second floor. It has no central A/C. Because it‚Äôs on the second floor, it can get warm in the late 
afternoon (roughly 83F max) but then it cools down.

Naturally, my closet stays cooler than the rest of the house, but there are times when it feels more tepid than cool. (I don‚Äôt know its actual temp). 

Many nights i‚Äôve tossed and turned this summer, thinking about my closet wines. I‚Äôve considered a wine fridge, but honestly there‚Äôs no room.

So, my questions to this great community: Do you think my wine is okay for the next couple years? Shall I invest in a wine fridge ASAP? Or, would it be fine to move my wines downstairs to my apartment‚Äôs shared garage (used for storage only with 2 other tenants)? I‚Äôm unsure how cool the garage is, but it‚Äôs an option.

We are looking to buy a few bottles while here to drink here, and a few to take home. Any suggestions on where the value is for someone coming from the US? Our budget is $30-200 but we can pick up one or two above that.

Visiting a few wine stores today, it seems that prices here are not that different from the US surprisingly (at least, if compared to some online US retailers - we love Bordeaux and have bought mainly from Saratoga Wine, Vivino and Total Wine). I was hoping against hope that some 1er cru left bank wines would be discounted here, but no such luck. Same seems to go for other classified growth wines. One notable difference is the shops do have a lot of older vintages on the shelves, whereas the US stores I visit tend to only have vintages going back 5 years, sometimes 10. Another difference is a lot of less expensive producers that aren‚Äôt imported where I live.

So I suppose I am thinking of using it as an opportunity to try some older vintages? We haven‚Äôt had much Bordeaux pre-2009. However, there‚Äôs a lot on the shelf from lesser vintages, like 2006-2008, 2011-2014. Anything from the best vintages, especially 2009 and more recent, seems close to or at US prices oddly.

Just checking to see if anyone has any thoughts or advice?

Oddly we had a very nice Sp√§tburgunder today that would be very hard to find in the US, as I basically never see German reds, as well as an excellent non-Tokaji Hungarian white.

I had a 2008 Lopez De Heredia Tondonia which I opened 2 days ago and it tasted oxidized and sour forcing me to use it in cooking. When buying this bottle online, I had shipped it in temperature controlled setting and even stored it in my 55 degree constant cellar. 

I never had to deal with this problem when collecting older scotches because spirits are not that sensitive to temp change unless severe and I‚Äôm getting frustrated because this last wine bottle was third in a few 2000s wines that I had opened recently only to be found it was cooked.",wine

514,t3_w7kcrc,thedreamed,Hosting a Blind Tasting for Casual Drinkers (Need ideas),"Hi guys,

I am hosting a blind tasting for a few family and friends. They're all casual drinkers, so I need to make it fun and laughs while being less technical, for example these questions will definitely be out: guessing cooler vs warmer vintages, varietals, or guessing Barolo vs Barbaresco. They are all red wine drinkers so I am keeping it along those lines, but who doesn't like bubbles?

What I am thinking of doing is something along the lines of the theme guessing new world vs old world with the same grape variety + guessing which one is a mature wine vs fresh wine.


Flight 1 - To guess which is the Cremant, Champagne and Prosecco

Prosecco vs Champagne vs Cr√©mant de Bourgogne

&amp;#x200B;

Flight 2 -  To guess which one is New/Old world, and which is the older vintage

Napa Cabernet/Chilean Cabernet vs Aged Bordeaux Cabernet

&amp;#x200B;

Flight 3 - Syrah vs Shiraz

Aged Cote Rotie/Hermitage or even SJ/CH vs Australian Shiraz

&amp;#x200B;

I can do a one or two more flights but ideally, would like to keep it under $500.  
Another idea is to use a points system, where the winner would take home a bottle of wine.",wine

543,t3_w7754w,Paperwork_Party,"Mid/upper tier recs based on flavor profile - smoky, spicy/vegetal, oaky?","After sporadically drinking wine over the last several years, I recently started paying more attention to what I‚Äôm drinking and am finding wines to be hit or miss. I would like to take my wine consumption to the next level, but think I need some direction.

The flavor profile that I seem to be drawn to is smoky, spicy, or oak-heavy. I had a 2016 barolo recently that I found to be smoky and honestly the best wine I have ever had. I also recently had a carmenere that was spicy and tasted to me like green bell pepper, which I loved. Would like to find more along these lines. 

The best wines that I have had thus far:

* Barolo ‚Äì 2016 Mauro Molino
* Carmenere ‚Äì 2018 Miguel Torres
* Gruner-Vetliner ‚Äì Tegernseerhof (oak and earthiness)
* Sparkling ‚Äì Cruse Wine Co. Tradition (this was phenomenal, it tasted like fresh fruit - a little different from what I'm describing, but still amazing)
* Pinot Noir from Willamette Valley is hit or miss (I really liked the spicy/cola flavor of King‚Äôs Ridge, but didn‚Äôt care for Chehalem or Annie Amie and thought Argyle was so-so. The pinot noir from California has all been average.)

I recognize that a lot of the wine I‚Äôve had is probably budget or value wine, and would much prefer to spend more to have a better experience. I eat out semi-frequently, and usually order whatever the most expensive glass is, but that doesn‚Äôt usually yield very good results. Recently, glasses of Chianti, Rhone, Beaujolais, Bordeaux, Gamay, Malbec, and Cabernet Sauvignon were all disappointing.

I thought spending more would ensure a better wine, so I recently bought bottles of Caymus (2016) and Silver Oak (2016), and honestly didn‚Äôt even care to finish the bottles. I‚Äôm not joking when I say that Caymus is probably the worst wine I have ever bought. Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Beaujolais all seem to have a distinct cheese flavor that I really don‚Äôt care for. I don‚Äôt want to count any varietal out, because it‚Äôs possible I just haven‚Äôt had a good version yet.

I know the first recommendation is to develop a relationship with a local wine shop. I‚Äôm in Washington, DC and I like MacArthur Beverages, which is where I got the Mauro Molino recommendation, however, a wine shop is limited to what they have in stock, and I want to go straight to the best that the world has to offer. I will continue to go to MacArthur, but would also like to order some bottles online that are not available locally.

Based on what I‚Äôve described, are there any wines that would be definite home-runs, so to speak? I don‚Äôt drink frequently enough to need budget-friendly options, but don‚Äôt want to spend $1000/bottle either. 

There are so many options out there that it‚Äôs daunting. Do I just drink 2016 barolo forever? Should I try Robert Voerzia or something cheaper like Vietti? If I try a new varietal, should I try the very best; I can read reviews and conclude that I need to try D‚Äôyquem and Mouton Rothschild, but what if these don‚Äôt fit my taste preferences, and end up being more expensive versions of Caymus and Silver Oak i.e. overspending on a flavor that I don‚Äôt even like.

And the '02 needed an hour plus to get going.  All the producers mentioned above have a certain amount of richness in their wines, and when coupled with the tension and acid that these bottles have, they're incredible.  They can be delicious young, but they can also be reductive, stressing their acid and minerality and not much else... delicious, but age can bring out their best.

I hate bitter and they are both bitter to me. I have friends that love wine and I wretch at the smell of it. It smells and tastes like rotten garbage to me. Red or white or sparkling, it doesn't matter. Just putting a teaspoon on my tongue makes it dry out.  


The only thing I can think is I wasn't raised with it and didn't develop a taste for it, or my genetics refuses to play along. Other alcohols vary in my degrees of disfavor. I can tolerate beer if it is ice cold and quickly imbibed. I love the smell of whiskey but it is like pouring turpentine in my mouth if it isn't mixed with something.   


I am a big fan of cocktails though. White Russians is my fave and one, whose name I forget contained 1 part amaretto, 1 part cranberry, and 1 part Venezuelan rum. Something ""snapper"" the guys at work called it.

&amp;#x200B;

In this weeks episode of ""Better Call Saul"" Gustavo Fring visits what looks to be a social club and orders a glass of red wine called ""Dressler &amp; Vaughn"", which I do not believe exists. 

David, who I presume is the GM or Somm comes over to check on Gustavo and clearly sees he is unimpressed with his BTG choice.  David springs into action and brings by a bottle of  Domaine Rostaing Cote Rotie ""La Landonne"" that was sent back by a guest who could not appreciate the wine. This begins a conversation of passion between Gustavo and David. David is clearly very passionate about wine and tells a story of his visits to the region, explains the terroir and how it effects the wine. He particularly focused on the high iron content of the soil, creating a sanguine or bloody character.  Gustavo is entranced and would love nothing less than to invite him home and enjoy a 1978 vintage of the same bottle. He refrains as I believe he does not want to put David in danger,  as Gustavo's main motivation throughout the Breaking Bad universe is revenge against the man who killed his previous lover.   


I was insanely impressed with this scenes attention to detail.   


Everything from the way to bartender poured the glass for Gustavo, to the research put into Cote Rotie and the impeccable acting of David the Somm that displayed his overwhelming passion for wine, blew me away.   


What an amazing scene for a wine lover!!

Today I decided to open it, fully aware of all of those expectations. 

Actually that's a lie, My wife opened it while I was upstairs as revenge for me opening a nice bottle one day without her around. Anyways she ran upstairs to tell me, ""Hey it's very good!"" And I would say her preferences lean towards Pinots and away from Cabs in general.

So of course I tried and I was pretty surprised and quite honestly impressed. 

It definitely had that candy fruity bomb to it, but for a young wine, it was also extremely smooth without much acidity that I could detect. This is in contrast to some of the 2019's I've tried, which I can feel are just too young. Somehow, Caymus engineered this outcome.

Ultimately, I now understand why the comments were of the, ""Drink what you like variety"". Because for what it's trying to achieve it's pretty good.",wine

I've seen a few posts like this in my search of this subreddit, but some are fairly old. While I don't expect the advice to change too much, though there could be some tech updates, my point for rehashing this question is that I'm sure there's plenty of people new to this sub that have advice they could share.*

*I've been in wine for 14 years. Focused on the hospitality side of the business and the past 8 years have specifically been winery hospitality. I'm a Cert. Somm, WSET 3, and studying for my DipWSET with the intent to keep moving towards MW. I've been hand selling wine to consumers for years, but selling to restaurants is an entirely different game.*

I'm not a distributor sales rep. I'm more on the supplier side. I represent one single brand, a ros√©, and I'm based in the small town of Los Angeles. This is a test brand, in a new test market, with a rep who just moved to LA and doesn't have any connections (me.) I represent a small boutique luxury brand, but I work for a large wine corporation (you know the one). As of right now, I've got my targeted list of accounts where we want this wine to be. I'm cold calling and popping into accounts, usually sitting down to dine, which usually starts with maybe getting a hand shake and a business card. My current struggle is getting the follow-up sales call. The business card doesn't mean much if they don't respond to my follow up and can't get a sales call appointment set up. Once I get there, what do you recommend for closing the deal? Do you have any tips beyond sales (accessories to have, apps to use, etc)? I don't have the luxury of a full portfolio, so there's an added challenge in only having one single wine to sell them.

Even very basic advice is handy. I have a cooler in my car to keep the wine cold, but transfer it to my bag when I get out of the car. So even advice like... get this frozen wine cooler sleeve (or don't waste your time), get these ice packs so you're not emptying your freezer of ice every day (or ice packs don't work, stick to real ice), or carry a Vacuvin in your bag to keep the wine fresh (I'm typically an argon gas fan, but in this case the VacuVin seems more efficient), etc. is all super helpful because some of that I'm learning as I go, but it could be nice to skip the line in that basic stuff. Oh, also the ADHD struggle is real, so organizational help is always appreciated as well

**TL;DR:** Brand new on-prem sales rep in LA. I represent one single wine, a ros√©. Despite plenty of wine knowledge and consumer sales experience, this is brand new and foreign to me. HELP!

The wine tastes like someone poured rubbing alcohol into the bottle. I get a mouth tingling, almost burning sensation, but no notes of fruit, or really anything else for that matter. I've previously had other bottles of wine that were in the same vein of astringency and poured them out immediately. I decided to give this a chance to see if this is what is meant when the wine is really tight and needs to open up. Even with a couple of hours of exposure to air, taking sips over that course of time, nothing really develops except maybe hints of fruit like they want to come out.

2. Buy in Airport duty free at some stage along the route (Currently my preferred option)

I was wondering if anyone could point me to facilities available around central Florida (Tampa, Saint Petersburg, Sarasota, or even Orlando area) that specialize in wine storage? Be it simply for storage or possibly places that also offer some extra amenities for wine enthusiasts to gather for tastings, as I‚Äôve read some places offer this?",wine

I mostly drink young, bright wines such as Zinfandels, Barberas, Syrahs/Shiraz, Nebbiolos, and Frappatos along with young California Cabernets, Pinots, and blends.

Based on the endless praise, I already picked up a [Gabriel-Glas Gold](https://gabriel-glasinternational.com/product/gabriel-glas-gift-box-gold-edition-mouth-blown/) as a universal glass (mostly for whites, sparkling, and as a reference for other glasses). I believe I'll also want a couple of other glasses for reds.

What kind of glass do I want for Zins? Riedel takes the position that a [white wine (Riesling) glass](https://riedel.com/en-us/shop/vinum/riesling-641600015) is appropriate for Zins. Based on that, I'm seeing the [Zalto Denk'Art White Wine](https://www.wineenthusiast.com/zalto-denkart-white-wine-glass) (recommended for ""medium bodied red wines without overt barrique development"") and the [Josephine No 1 ‚Äì White](https://us.josephinen.com/products/josephine-1) as potential options.

Anyways, this last week I did a bit of research on what wines pair well with, and everything I read suggested that Cabernet Sauvignon and aged cheddar go hand-in-hand. I thought that would be perfect because I really enjoy red wines and cheddar cheese, so I figured I would try it out. I picked up a bottle of DAOU 2020 Cab, and some 6 year aged cheddar from a local grocery mart (DOMs for anyone in the Chicagoland area). 

Reaction: the pairing didn‚Äôt seem to play off each other like a Malbec and NY strip steak. I apologize if that is not a great comparison. However, the cheddar and wine both had a level tannins that didn‚Äôt seem connect one another which made it unpleasant. The cheese didn‚Äôt seem to have much fattiness or even creaminess to balance the wine tannins. I found the wine and cheese to both be pleasant, but my argument is that it shouldn‚Äôt be paired.

824,t3_vzemwt,Joshuajin,My first wine experience: Wayne Gretzky VQA Cabernet Merlot Red 13% $15,"Didn't plan on having wine today, but stumbled on it in a food delivery app and couldn't resist.

Note: over a decade ago, i actually had wine a couple times - but only to get drunk...i had no idea of how to taste wine

That said, i bought Gretzky's wine because i figure there's no way he'd release wine that tastes below it's pricepoint...given him being the #1 athlete ever.

I have seen 20+ expert wine tasting videos, especially the YouTube channel WineKing. I read a blog post linked here which states wine tasting is bull - well, i'm sure it isn't even without any experience, because of those vids. They accurately identify high quality wines, and point out cheap ones. So i know it's legit.

Not to mention, i would say i am and expert (Master, even) in ketchup. Tomatoes &amp; grapes share many similarities. There are many varieties, each with their own quality. Most ketchup, as wine, from stores is *trash*. It's artificially sweetened way sweeter than ketchup is supposed to be. Therefore, while i'm a beginner with wine, i know this  hobby is legitimate.

When opening the bottle, i noticed mostly alcohol &amp; grape on the nose. In fact, the entire tasting, the alcohol &amp; grape are the only flavors. I did not detect anything else. Likely due to my inexperience, but i really took my time and didn't notice anything.

Here are my exact notes of the tasting, over the course of ~20min:

- Sip 1: mostly alcohol

(basically my throat got warm and alcohol went in my nose)

I must add - i have never liked alcohol. I grew up never drinking carbonated beverages. Beer was not something i enjoyed. At least, not something i buy to drink for enjoyment. Same goes for all other alcohol i've had (most spirits, etc.). So keep this in mind as i really do not like alcohol.

- Sip 2: light mild, clear grape, not overpowering...barely any alcohol flavor, pleasant

- Sip 3: big gulp, alcoholy

- Sip 4: still nothing on nose, big gulp, alcoholy

- Sip 5: gulp, fruity, cinnamon, spicy

- 6: bland

- 7: nothing to note

- 8: pleasant

- 9: fruit, still alcoholy

Overall, i would say based on my experience watching many tasting videos that this wine is a fair quality for it's pricepoint. It definitely isn't bad. A few sips were actually enjoyable, while the others were mostly overpowering with the alcohol flavor, which isn't my thing but i presume every wine has.

I don't even know if i have to refridgerate it now...so i'm gonna Google that.",wine

844,t3_vyvyzu,watermooses,Fruitiness vs Complexity,"I was fortunate enough to try some wines that would typically be out of my price range recently.  Austin Hope and Artemis.  The Austin Hope seemed to be super jammy to me.  I enjoyed my first glass, but after a couple it was just too sweet for me.  The Artemis seemed to have a bit more tannic or oak structure (not sure which?) than the AH, but still ended up just tasting overly sweet toward the end of the bottle.

I also tried a right bank Bordeaux recently.  I enjoyed it with steak, and this wine also seemed quite fruity to me, but did have more oak to it than I remembered from the Cali Cabs.  It was roughly 80% Merlot.

I keep coming back to Spanish Riojas though.  I had a Gran Reserva recently and much like I've noticed with other Riojas, the flavor seemed to evolve as I enjoyed the bottle.  And each sip has layers to it.  With oakyness giving way to fruit and lingering with lovely earthiness.

Are the first three wines I mentioned really fruit bombs or is my palate just not attuned to a more subtle complexity in those wines?  Can I find cabs with more complexity like the Riojas, or is that really just a difference between Cali Cabs and Riojas?  I was expecting more complexity from the Bordeaux, but when I considered that it's predominately Merlot, the fruitiness with light oak made sense.  Would a left bank, more Cab heavy Bordeaux be more complex than the Cali Cabs I tried or should I not expect much different, since they're the same grapes?  

What styles should I seek out going forward that offer more complexity like the riojas I've been enjoying?",wine

I just drink cocktails, usually fruity, flavorful ones, although I'm open to different tastes too. Nevertheless, even with limited experience and availability, there are usually lists for what spirits/modifiers are best suited to cocktails versus sipping. This means, I can go just buy whatever is recommended and see if it works for my palate. The information available is plentiful for spirits, less so with liqueurs. However, there seems to be no information regarding the suitability of wines for cocktails. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, there is no point in asking staff at my liquor store, as most of them aren't even aware of cocktails featuring wine. So I figured I'd try my luck here. Is there anything specific to look for? Any brands? Distinctive features? Tasting notes? Should you go expensive? Or you can skimp on the premium stuff?

880,t3_vxv1gj,175doubledrop,Feeling a bit lost and frustrated trying to find reds I like at a reasonable budget (details inside),"Preface: This will probably be a bit of a lengthy post so bear with me‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve been what I would describe as a ‚Äúhobbyist‚Äù wine drinker on and off for about ~6 years.  What really got me into wine was getting to try some pretty solid (to my palette) central CA Pinot noirs that showed me that there was more to red wine than just single note red fruit flavors, and I got hooked into finding those wines with multiple levels of flavor and complexity.

Fast forward to current day, and I feel like I‚Äôve hit a road block when it comes to finding wine I enjoy within a reasonable budget.  In general with red varietals, I love wines that have earthy/savory/non-sweet flavors mixed in with the fruit.  I first loved finding Pinot noirs that exhibited that classic earthy/mushroom note along with the usual cherry/strawberry/red raspberry.  With Cabernet, I love cabs that have that tobacco/leather/graphite character to them.  I also love oaky Rioja Riserva‚Äôs and Barolo when budget allows.

Recently, I was in Leavenworth, WA , and my wife and I decided to go for a tasting at a local winery there, and I tried their 2019 Syrah and was blown away by the gamey/savory flavors in it.  They balanced well with the rest of the wine and I instantly wanted to find more like it, so I searched this sub for WA Syrah recommendations and went and picked up a handful of bottles in the $25-35 price range.  Sadly none of them had those savory flavors I was craving and all of them seemed incredibly fruit forward and lacking much depth/complexity to them.

Upon reflecting on this, I‚Äôve noticed over time that a lot of the wine I purchase just doesn‚Äôt give me much complexity or depth of flavor.  My usual styles/varietals of choose are pinot noir, rhone blends, and the occasional rioja, but even when I dabble in other varietals (like my Syrah exploration above), everything I buy in that $25-35 price range just seems to be lacking something.  I've gotten lucky and found a few budget gems, but they seem to be few and far between.  The only way I've been able to break this trend is by spending $50+ a bottle and that seems to be the sort of breakthrough pricepoint where I find a lot of winners.  As you might imagine though, this isn't financially sustainable for me on a regular basis.

I'm at a loss as to where I'm going wrong or why I can't find stuff I like.  I research not just varietals but regions and appellations as well as searching this sub a ton to try to zero in on producers and regions that will agree with my tastes, but I still end up with bottles that I don't end up enjoying.

Any tips/guidance you can offer me?

To answer a few basic questions that I'm sure will come up:

* I'm located in Seattle, WA
* I usually shop at my local Total Wine but have also started shopping at a local wine shop near me that gets good reviews but without much change in my outcome.
* Ideally I'd like to stay in the $25-35/bottle range, but I also realize with some varietals/styles it can be tough to get quality at this price.  I'm willing to spend more for the right bottles but am trigger shy for the reasons laid out above.
* No I don't have COVID, taste buds and smell receptors are still in great shape :)

Waiter uncorks, offers me my taste, I taste, and there is 0 (ZERO) flavor or aroma to it. It was like i was smelling a glass of water. Now I know Banfi isn't exactly known for being the best producer in Italy, but for a brunello from what I've heard is such a great vintage, I expected SOMETHING. The glass of basic Valpolicella I ordered had WAY more intense aromas than this bottle.

So anyway I let the waiter know that I believe the wine is bad, and he takes a taste to the ""somm in training"", who says it is exactly how it is supposed to be. 

While i have some experience in wine as a hobby, i am certainly not a professional. So I accepted,  and hoped that maybe it just needed time in a decanter to show something. But even after an hour, it showed absolutely nothing and only became more vinegary. 

It was very unenjoyable, the rest of the table drank it and chalked it up to ""just not being a great wine"".

Basically I'm looking for 3 things: 
1. Has anyone who's had this wine and vintage experienced this? Am I crazy and making wrong assumptions about this wine?

2. Is there a proper term if what I'm describing is a fault? Perhaps the wine was oxidized?

3. If this happens again in the future, do I argue with the somm? Like I said, I'm not exactly a professional so what if I am wrong and they opened me another bottle and it was the same issue? Could they have charged me twice?",wine

Further info: I generally like brioche. I like yeast, but find it a bit obvious. I wasn't that happy with Krug NV partly for this reason. I don't think I particularly go for a dry style. My favourite grape is gewurz so I am normally drinking that quite sweet. HOWEVER, I tried Veuve demi-sec (to explore the idea that ""at one time, all Champagne was sweet"" which I read when learning about shipwrecked fizz) but it was extremely not ok for me. I don't know why but it was quite sickly sweet and to me smelled of sweaty feet.......

I could go on and on but if I stop now it might be best.

PS because I couldn't stop, ironically I dislike Chardonnay so would also be interested to know about non-C Champagne which I know exists. This is really a separate question though.",wine

There seems to be one, maybe two wineries in the Russian River Valley that still make a few bottles and that's it. But I couldn't figure out WHY this wine so dramatically disappeared, does anyone know? Was there a pest? Was it because it was a California mutation of grape and the 80s was when Napa/Sonoma was really becoming a powerhouse and dedicated to having a high end reputation?

Basically, I'm looking to cook with it maybe once every two weeks.  It's just me, so the amount I'll need will be minimal, maybe 2 ounces at a time.  I'm trying to do this frugally, but, I've learned my lesson not to cook with wines that I wouldn't drink, so it's difficult finding something affordable.  I'm also, for the immediate future, on the wagon, so I can't really drink what I don't use- and throwing away wine, especially half decent wine, would kill me.

I've tried freezing wine in the past in ice cube trays, and it never really froze solid, and made a huge mess.  Also, my freezer is frost free, and it trashes anything you put in it for an extended period of time with constant freeze/thaw cycles.

So... I've been looking at 187 ml bottles.  I need something dry-ish (keto), and the guy in the store said that the Cavit Pinot Grigio would be better than the Sutter Home Sauvignon Blanc.  I asked him about half bottles, and he told that those are typically not very cost effective. Ideally, I'd really like to keep the wine component of the dish down to about $2.

I'm open to any and all ideas. Summing up, I'm looking for something white, dry, drinkable that I can use 2 ounces of every 2 weeks that I don't have to freeze- and that won't break the bank.",wine

My wife and I are two wine enthusiasts, however she has had some strange reactions twice after drinking french wines and I wonder if anyone else has experienced something similar.

The first time was a couple years ago, I dont recall the specific wine but it was a margaux. Yesterday we had a 2015 Cab Franc from the Chinon region called Les Picasses from the Olga Raffault winery and she had the same reation.

Basically she felt very sick after we finished the bottle. Everything was spinning and she had to sleep on the floor to feel better. Today she has a massive hangover and I feel fine. 

I know it sounds like she just overdrank but it is not the case since splitting one bottle of wine is not abnormal in our household and she has only had reactions like these twice in over 4 years, always after drinking french wines.

What we feel like is that she may have some sensitivity to them somehow...

Anyway, if anyone knows what may have caused this please let us know. We would hate to have to stop drinking french wines altogether but we dont want to risk for her to go through that again.

I've posted/commented a few times in here over the years, less so in the past two because of work. 

I am a french winemaker who settled in Portugal, in the D√£o region two years ago. 
In 2020 we made a bit of wine but couldn't legally sell it.  For 2021 i finally managed to start an actual production of two cuv√©es. We started presenting them in Portugal and France over the past month. I was trained in Burgundy and beaujolais, very naturally oriented in the wine i enjoy although I tend to avoid crazy aromatic deviations (to each their own). In the winery, I am very much low intervention, only using sulfur, and letting the grapes do their thing. 

If someone is coming trough Portugal, hit me up if you want to stop by.

993,t3_wmp0j1,JAHwise_0388,Shipping wines from Italy to US questions?,"So I am planning to travel to Italy soon and scheduling to visit a few wineries. My initial plan was to possibly have a few cases shipped back to the states.
I contacted Mail Boxes Etc. in Lucca and they quoted me 269‚Ç¨ per case! I‚Äôve read a few people recommend them and cited a lower price (around 140‚Ç¨/case) so I thought the quote I received was quite high. I don‚Äôt know if this is a result of inflation and post covid consequences or maybe just this specific office, and should maybe ask around to other offices of theirs? 
Kinda throws a wrench in my plans. However I have also read some wineries are able to ship direct and could also include some cases from other wineries if buying from them as well? Not sure how to handle that, if so.

I‚Äôm thinking to maybe see who the importers are for the wineries I visit and just buy stateside if possible, however I may be limited in vintage selection or possibly pay comparable prices to handling shipping myself? 

Any advice and input would be great, thanks",wine
